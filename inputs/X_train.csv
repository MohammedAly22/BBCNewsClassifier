1230,asia quake increases poverty risk nearly two million people across asia could be thrown into poverty because of the indian ocean tsunami the asian development bank (adb) has said. in its first overview of the disaster the adb said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage. but the blow to many low-income people could be enormous . the paris club of rich creditor nations on wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunami-hit countries. the move was aimed at helping south asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas though so far only sri lanka indonesia and the seychelles have indicated that they will take it up. other countries believe their economies are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed as credit risks. poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster said adb chief economist ifzal ali. donor nations have promised to give $ (£) in disaster relief over the next six months according to the united nations. mr ali added his voice to those warning that aid pledges must be promptly delivered saying the number of people at risk of poverty hinged on concerns over sanitation and health conditions and other basic needs being properly and quickly addressed . there are . billion people in asia living on less than $ a day. the adb fears that million indonesians could join them while in india just over half a million people - - are at risk of falling into poverty. a quarter of a million sri lankans and people in the maldives are also facing poverty. in the maldives where % of the population already lives on less than $ a day this could rise to half. sri lanka and the maldives are the two countries the adb fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami. sri lanka s government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $. a government task force held meetings to discuss an emergency rebuilding plan with the adb world bank and japanese aid agencies on wednesday and promised to publish the plan within days. indonesia malaysia thailand and india have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years which should cushion them against reconstruction costs. although indonesia s northern province of aceh suffered the worst death toll the region s oil and natural gas production facilities have survived intact the report said. however it remains too soon to asses the damage to poor people s livelihoods in aceh because it would depend on how much farm land had been flooded by seawater. this is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering. but the economies of the affected countries except sri lanka and the maldives should emerge with minimal damage the adb report said. some businesses may even gain from the reconstruction efforts thereby creating jobs. at a meeting in thailand abd president thadao chino said he was confident of the country s own capabilities to restore normalcy to the affected areas and meet the rehabilitation requirements . thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze while india has also rejected international aid saying it can cope on its own resources. debt repayment holidays carry the risk of credit ratings downgrades making it more expensive to borrow money in future. indonesia however is pressing for greater help with its debts than the current freeze would bring. it is one of the world s most indebted countries.

1228,savvy searchers fail to spot ads internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits. the report by the us pew research center reveals that % of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. it also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. the report reveals that % of net users say they regularly use google ask jeeves msn and yahoo when online. almost % of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden. according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about minutes per month carrying out separate searches and looks at . webpages for each hunt. a significant chunk of net users % carry out a search at least weekly and % of those asked only look every few weeks. for % of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find. search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. according to pew research % of searchers use just a single search engine % use two or three and a small number % consult more than three sites. tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. a small number % said they wouldn t really miss search engines if they did not exist. the remaining % said they could not live without search sites. more than two-thirds of those questioned % said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web. of those asked % were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search. only % of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. said the pew report: this finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results. commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference.

51,strike threat over pension plans millions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer warn union leaders. the cabinet office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system prompting unions representing . workers to threaten united action. they believe the plans include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from to . the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made. it is thought the proposed overhaul due on thursday could mean pensions could be based on a career average salary. for each year served staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years. ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election which is widely expected next may. in a statement on sunday the cabinet office said it was reviewing the civil service pension scheme and hoped to announce proposals soon. unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes. public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable. people are living longer and pensions are getting more expensive. to maintain the long-term affordability of our pension scheme the government announced in its green paper on pensions that pension age would rise from to . on monday tony blair s official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans. he said: what s important is that there s a process going on it s out for consultation at the moment let s wait for that process to complete itself. there is already widespread anger over the chancellor s plans to get rid of more than civil servants. now public service unions are united against the plans and the trades union congress is discussing the issue next monday. dave prentis general secretary of unison said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal. members working in the nhs or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away he said. what really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of mps who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in europe but say they can t afford it for anyone else. this is a position that unison cannot accept and will oppose. it will lead to conflict between unison and the government if not this year then next. mr prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government. mark serwotka from the public and commercial services union said there should be a co-ordinated one day strike unless there was a government rethink. the fire brigades union said the government was planning to cut ill health retirement benefits for firefighters and other measures to chip away at pensions. pensions officer paul woolstenholmes said: the pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat - apart from mps and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country.
2041,virus poses as christmas e-mail security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card. the zafi.d virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. anti-virus firm sophos said that % of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus. like many other windows viruses zafi-d plunders microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. the attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces. the virus subject line says merry christmas and translates this into one of languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. the message in the body of the e-mail reads: happy holidays and this too is translated. on infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus. the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america italy spain bulgaria and hungary. the original zafi virus appeared in april this year. we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards and we recommend this to all our clients too said mikko hypponen who heads f-secure s anti-virus team.

506,chelsea clinch cup in extra-time (after extra-time - score at mins -) john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after seconds but steven gerrard scored a -minute own goal. blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunez s header made for a tense finale. it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager. yet it was controversial too after mourinho s sending off apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans. there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute. riise could not have connected any better with morientes cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past petr cech. the goal the quickest-ever in a league cup final stunned a blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week. the blues attacking chances were limited and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard s powerfully-struck drive and drogba s low shot. despite their frustration chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpool s well-organised defence. joe cole had a shot blocked and a promising damien duff break was halted by a good tackle from djimi traore but the reds reached half-time without any major scares. the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back. nevertheless liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from dudek on minutes first at full stretch from gudjohnsen s header then to smother william gallas follow-up. and despite chelsea s possession it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech. and the blues increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected ferrerira s free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level. that prompted mourinho s reaction which saw him sent off but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. dudek saved bravely at the irishman s feet while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. but seconds after the half-time interval drogba made no mistake picking the ball up from glen johnson s long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsen s cross in the minute. there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level but despite liverpool s desperate attacks chelsea clung on to win. dudek finnan carragher hyypia traore (biscan ) luis garcia gerrard hamann riise kewell (nunez ) morientes (baros ). subs not used: pellegrino carson. hyypia traore hamann carragher. riise nunez . cech paulo ferreira ricardo carvalho terry gallas (kezman ) jarosik (gudjohnsen ) lampard makelele cole (johnson ) drogba duff. subs not used: pidgeley tiago. lampard kezman drogba duff. gerrard og drogba kezman . s bennett (kent).
1969,juninho demand for o neill talks juninho s agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with martin o neill as the brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing celtic. brian hassell says no official approach has been received from manchester city but that the english club had been earmarked as a possible destination. but it was being stressed to bbc sport that juninho would prefer to remain with the scottish champions. juninho wants assurances that he will return to o neill s first-team plans. he has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from middlesbrough in the summer. hassel says juninho who has just bought a new home would desperately like to stay at celtic but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted. the agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the -year-old s father being in scotland and talk of a move back to botafogo in brazil. juninho s father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. i know there is interest from a brazilian club but i know juninho doesn t want to go there said hassel. he wants to stay in britain. in fact he wants to stay at celtic. hassall made it clear that a move to manchester city who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker was more of a possibility than botafogo or mexican outfit red sharks veracruz who also expressed an interest. it was a thought at one stage he said. if you are not going to get a game under one manager you look for another whose style of play suits you. he is a fan of kevin keegan s style of play. it would not be a bad move for him. juninho had earlier told the daily record: the manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn t happened. if that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. that would be good for the club and good for me. if i have no part in his plans there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes. the attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss martin o neill since his move to celtic park. i can t understand why i am in this situation he continued. when a manager brings a new player to the club he gives that player support.

908,british library gets wireless net visitors to the british library will be able to get wireless internet access alongside the extensive information available in its famous reading rooms. broadband wireless connectivity will be made available in the eleven reading rooms the auditorium caf& restaurant and outdoor piazza area. a study revealed that % of visitors to the library carried laptops. the technology has been on trial since may and usage levels make the library london s most active public hotspot. previously many were leaving the building to go to a nearby internet caf& to access their e-mail the study found. at the british library we are continually exploring ways in which technology can help us to improve services to our users said lynne brindley chief executive of the british library. surveys we conducted recently confirmed that alongside the materials they consult here our users want to be able to access the internet when they are at the library for research or to communicate with colleagues she said. the service will be priced at £. for an hour s session or £ for a monthly pass. the study conducted by consultancy building zones found that % of visitors came to the library to sit down and use it as a business centre. this could be because of its proximity to busy mainline stations such as kings cross and euston. the study also found that people were spending an average of six hours in the building making it an ideal wireless hotspot. since may the service has registered sessions per week making it london s most active public hotspot. the majority of visitors wanted to be able to access their e-mail as well as the british library catalogue. the service has been rolled out in partnership with wireless provider the cloud and hewlett packard. it will operate independently from the library s existing network. the british library receives around visitors each day and serves around readers each year. people come to view resources which include the world s largest collection of patents and the uk s most extensive collection of science technology and medical information. the library receives between three and four million requests from remote users around the world each year.
721,no re-draft for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps. the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review all aspects of the directive . the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words computer implemented invention . in a letter ec president jos& manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament josep borrell that the commission did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council (of ministers) as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may . if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament. but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law. french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament s request it would be an insult to the assembly. he said that the parliament would then reject the council s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its one-click shopping service for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.
21,halo heralds traffic explosion the growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms warns network monitoring company sandvine. it issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of halo . the november traffic explosion has continued into december said sandvine. service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth. as well as being a popular single-player title halo can be connected to microsoft s subscription-based broadband network xbox live. gamers who want to play online can create their own clan or team and take on others to see how well they compare. but the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic said sandvine s chief technology officer marc morin. in a bid to cope and ease congestion providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent finding out who is using bandwidth and for what. it could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use. the explosion in xbox live traffic attributed to halo should be seen as a clarion call he said. isps need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games he added. one of the main factors that spoils online gaming is lag in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world. gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest lag . analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said lindsay schroth an analyst with research firm the yankee group. in the competitive broadband environment operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming she said. in countries such as korea which has high levels of fast net connections to homes online gaming is hugely popular.
666,steady job growth continues in us the us created fewer jobs than expected in december but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world s biggest economy. according to labor department figures new jobs were added last month. that took s total to . million the best showing in five years. job creation was one of last year s main concerns for the us economy. while worries still remain the conditions are set for steady growth in analysts said. the unemployment rate stayed at .% in december and about jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop. it was a respectable report said michael moran analyst at daiwa securities. payroll growth in december was a little lighter than the consensus forecast but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment. manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it s showing job growth it s a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track. that means that the federal reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. the fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to .% citing evidence the us economic recovery was becoming more robust. job creation was one of last year s main concerns for the us economy and proved to be a main topic of debate in the us presidential election. while demand for workers is far from booming the conditions are set for steady growth. overall compared to the previous year it looks great it just keeps going stronger and stronger and i expect that to be the case in said kurt karl economist at swiss re in new york. meanwhile economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the federal reserve showing an unexpected $. drop in consumer debt in november. a fall in consumer spending which makes up about two-thirds of all us economic activity could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. but economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing which include credit cards and personal loans while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.
98,japan narrowly escapes recession japan s economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to september figures show. revised figures indicated growth of just .% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. on an annual basis the data suggests annual growth of just .% suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. a common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth. the government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. i maintain the view that japan s economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb and we will monitor developments carefully said economy minister heizo takenaka. but in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead observers were less sanguine. it s painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought said paul sheard economist at lehman brothers in tokyo. improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand with private consumption up just .% in the third quarter.
610,broadband fuels online expression fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online research suggests. a quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites according to a report by uk think-tank demos. it said that having an always-on fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. more than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast. the demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people s net habits. it found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. one in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. more significantly argues the report broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online. it found that one in five post something on the net everyday ranging from comments or opinions on sites to uploading photographs. broadband is putting the me in media as it shifts power from institutions and into the hands of the individual said john craig co-author of the demos report. from self-diagnosis to online education broadband creates social innovation that moves the debate beyond simple questions of access and speed. the demos report entitled broadband britain: the end of asymmetry was commissioned by net provider aol. broadband is moving the perception of the internet as a piece of technology to an integral part of home life in the uk said karen thomson chief executive of aol uk with many people spending time on their computers as automatically as they might switch on the television or radio. according to analysts nielsen//netratings more than % of the . million uk net users regularly accessing the web from home each month are logging on at high speed they spend twice as long online than people on dial-up connections viewing an average of pages per month. the popularity of fast net access is growing partly fuelled by fierce competition over prices and services.
591,david blunkett in quotes david blunkett - who has resigned as home secretary - built his reputation as a plain-speaking yorkshire man. i fell in love with someone and they wouldn t go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer and then the news of the world picked up the story. i tried for three years to make something work. trust plain-speaking and straight talking is something which matters so much to me as a politician and as a man that i have decided of my own volition to request an independent review of the allegations that i misused my position. i don t think anyone can say i have said one thing in public and done another in private. it would be dangerous territory if i wasn t practising what i preach which is to always accept responsibility always accept the consequences of your actions. none of us believe countering terrorism is about party politics. i accepted by necessity we have to have prevention under a new category which is to intervene before the act is committed rather than do so by due process after the act is committed when it s too late he said in reference to new anti-terrorism measures. our work with the french government...has been hugely successful said mr blunkett. the number of illegal immigrants detected in dover has dropped dramatically. strengthening our identity is one way or reinforcing people s confidence and sense of citizenship and well-being. i foolishly thought as this was a celebrity edition it would be more relaxed than normal. you wake up and you receive a phone call - shipman s topped himself. you have just got to think for a minute: is it too early to open a bottle
2044,kennedy begins pre-election tour liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has begun a week-long tour to persuade voters they are the real opposition . mr kennedy is visiting constituencies in somerset and hampshire on monday - rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives. later he will visit places such as liverpool where labour is targeted. labour say a lib dem vote could let the tories in while the tories say the lib dems would mean higher taxes soft crime laws more power to europe . mr kennedy s tour comes as he labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election widely expected to be held on may. on tuesday mr kennedy will visit leicester south where lib dem mp parmjit singh gill overturned a big labour majority to win the seat in last year s by-election. stops in shrewsbury north dorset liverpool manchester basingstoke and west london are planned for later in the week. the liberal democrats say in the northern cities the race is between them and labour while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the tories. speaking to the bbc s westminster hour on sunday mr kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for may - would be much more unpredictable than any others in recent experience . asked whether it was realistic to assume the liberal democrats could win the general election he said: there s no limit to the ambitions we have as a party. but we have got to be responsible we have got to be credible we have got to demonstrate to people that we are up to that task. mr kennedy said the british public felt let down by labour on issues from iraq to top-up fees and the conservatives were not asking the critical questions . and he said people were highly sceptical about labour and conservative promises on tax. but he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in by the back door . if you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections the liberal democrats have demonstrated that not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position but we can go on to defeat the government. that s going to be the story i think of this coming general election.

763,shares rise on new man utd offer shares in manchester united closed up .% on monday following a new offer from us tycoon malcolm glazer. the board of the football club is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal which values the club at £ ($.). manchester united revealed on sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from mr glazer which looks set to receive more serious scrutiny. the club has previously rejected mr glazer s approaches out of hand. but a senior source at the club told the bbc: this time it s different. supporters group shareholders united however urged the club to reject the new deal. a spokesman for the shareholders united said: i can t see any difference (compared to mr glazer s previous proposals) other than £ less debt. he isn t bringing any money into the club; he ll use our money to buy it. mr glazer s latest move is being led by mr glazer s two sons avi and joel according to the financial times. a proposal was received by david gill united s chief executive at the end of last week pitched at about a share. david cummings head of uk equities for standard life investments said he believed a well funded a share bid would be enough for mr glazer to take control of the club. i do not think there is anything that manchester united fans can do about it he told the bbc. they can complain about it but it is curtains for them. they may not want him but they are going to get him. the us tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last months has approached the united board with detailed proposals it has confirmed. mr glazer who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. he is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal though it is not clear by how much. for his proposal to succeed he needs the support of united s largest shareholders the irish horseracing tycoons jp mcmanus and john magnier. they own % of united through their cubic expression investment vehicle. mr glazer and his family hold a stake of .%. but it is not yet known whether mr mcmanus and mr magnier would support a glazer bid. nm rothschild the investment bank is advising mr glazer according to the financial times. his previous adviser jpmorgan quit last year when mr glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three united directors to the board against its advice. but the ft said it thought jp morgan may still have had some role in financing mr glazer s latest financial proposal.
1052,bush website blocked outside us surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re-election site of president george w bush. the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning. since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it. the blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers but as a result of a policy decision by the bush camp. the international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. netcraft said that since the early hours of october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney failed. by contrast netcraft s four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems. the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us. some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site. the pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers. geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. on october the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages videos and other content on its site reaches visitors. mike prettejohn president of netcraft speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run-up to the election on november. he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. however simply blocking non-us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too. akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites.
651,wife swap makers sue us copycat the british producers of us wife swap are taking legal action against a show they claim is a blatant and wholescale copycat of their programme. rdf media which makes the show for us network abc has filed a damages claim for $ million (£. million) against fox s trading spouses. abc bought the rights to the british show which was first aired in and became a hit on channel . the us network is not part of the claim but has supported rdf s action. we respect our producing partners right to protect their intellectual property in whatever manner they deem most appropriate said abc in a statement. a spokesman for fox said it had not seen the details of the legal action and could not comment. their show was first screened in june and was criticised in the press for its similarities to wife swap. abc originally planned to call their programme trading moms but changed it to avoid confusion with the fox version. earlier this year the nbc network claimed that fox s boxing show the next great champ had been hurriedly produced to ensure its programme was the first to be screened. nbc alleged that boxing regulations had been violated but failed in their attempt to have the show pulled. the fox show proved a ratings flop while nbc s the contender is due to begin in february.
1389,hewitt decries career sexism plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in labour s election manifesto the trade and industry secretary has said. patricia hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated but it was an increasingly high priority and a shared goal across government . ms hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the equal opportunities commission (eoc). mothers can currently take up to six months paid leave - and six unpaid. ms hewitt told the seminar: clearly one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. we are looking at how quickly we can do that because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that. ms hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and taster courses for men and women in non-traditional jobs. women in full-time work earn % less than men according to the equal opportunities commission (eoc). the minister told delegates that getting rid of career sexism was vital to closing the gender pay gap. career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. it is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex she said. earlier she told bbc radio s today programme: what we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women so we have got very segregated employment. unfortunately in some cases this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women or indeed for men. career sexism is about saying that engineering for instance where only % of employees are women is really a male-dominated industry. construction is even worse. but it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. career sexism goes both ways. she added that while progress had been made there was still a gap in pay figures. the average woman working full-time is being paid about for every pound a man is earning. for women working part-time it is . the department for trade and industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the tuc. it has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. research conducted by the eoc last year revealed that many britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of natural differences between the sexes. women hold less than % of the top positions in ftse companies the police the judiciary and trade unions according to their figures. and retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.
799,godzilla gets hollywood fame star movie monster godzilla has received a star on hollywood s walk of fame honouring both his birthday and the launch of his film. an actor dressed as the giant creature breathed smoke over photographers on monday as godzilla received the star on hollywood boulevard. godzilla should thank you for this historical and monumental star said final wars producer shogo tomiyama. but unfortunately he cannot speak english he added. hollywood s honorary mayor johnny grant said: i do hereby proclaim this godzilla day in hollywood. he s loose he s wild and i m getting the hell out of here he added. the premiere of godzilla: final wars at grauman s chinese theatre followed the ceremony on hollywood boulevard. the monster was joined by co-stars including japanese pop star and actor masahiro matsuoka. director ryuhei kitamura said it may not be godzilla s final outing as it has been billed. that s what the producers say. but the producer s a liar he said.

1690,rapper cent scores chart first rapper cent has become the first solo artist to have three singles in the us top five in the same week. his track candy shop remained at the top of the charts while disco inferno crept up from six to five. cent also appears on rap protege the game s song how we do number four in the us but now outside the uk top ten. the pair had a recent dispute which saw the game thrown out of cent s rap collective g-unit accusing him of disloyalty in an ongoing feud. cent who burst onto the music scene in has had less success in the uk charts with three singles making the top ten. his debut album get rich and die tryin narrowly missed out on becoming a uk chart topper. but in the us he headed the end of year charts for the album and r&b and hip hop artists. newcomer the game s debut reached the top of the charts five weeks ago while cent s second collection the masscre was released in the us at the end of last week. last may r&b star usher scored a chart first with three concurrent singles in the us top a feat which was previously matched only by the bee gees and the beatles. the hit songs were taken from the -year-old s confessions album which topped the american chart for eight weeks.
2153,set your television to wow television started off as a magical blurry image. then came the sharpness the colour and the widescreen format. now the tv set is taking another leap forward into a crystal clear future although those in europe will have to be patient. after years of buzz about high-definition tv (hdtv) it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world mainly the us and japan. if you believe the hype then hdtv will so wow you that you will never want to go back to your old telly. hdtv is just the latest must-have technology in viewers homes says jo flaherty a senior broadcaster with the cbs network in the us. all television images are made up of pixels going across the screen and scan lines going down. british tv pictures are made up of lines and about pixels. by contrast hdtv offers up to active lines with each line made up of pixels. the result is a picture which can be up to six times as sharp as standard tv. but to get the full impact programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a hdtv set to receive them. most new computer displays are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures. viewers in japan the us australia canada and south korea are already embracing the new tv technology with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format which includes . digital surround sound. but tv viewers in europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images. many high-end european tv programmes such as the recent athens olympics are already being produced in high-definition. but they still reach your screen in the old lines. the prospects for getting sharper images soon do not seem very encouraging. according to consultants strategy analytics only % of homes in europe will have tvs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by . but the hdtv hype spilling out of the us and japan has spurred european broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change. big sports and entertainment events are set to help trigger the general public s attention. the world cup in germany will be broadcast in high-definition. in the uk satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in . there is already a hdtv service in europe called . other european broadcasters especially in france and germany also aiming to launch similar services. in britain digital satellite and cable are largely seen as the natural home for hdtv at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options. the communications watchdog ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequencies freed up when the uk switches off its analogue tv signal. for now broadcasters like the bbc are working on their own hdtv plans although with no launch date in sight. the bbc will start broadcasting in hdtv when the time is right and it would not be just a showcase but a whole set of programming says andy quested from the bbc s high-definition support group. we have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by which would put us on the leading edge. one of the options under consideration is to offer high-definition pictures on the web. the bbc has already dipped its toe into this including some hdtv content in recent trials of its interactive media player - a video player for pcs. it is planning to offer special releases of selected flagship programmes online in the near future. according to mr quested this could help put europe back into the running in the race to switch to hdtv. this is backed by recent research which suggests that the number of europeans with broadband has exploded over the past months with the web eating into tv viewing habits.
457,podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to songs which is a lot of space to fill. but more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. it is called podcasting and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. a podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create usually in the comfort of their own home. they need only a microphone a pc and some editing software. they then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them all for free. using technology based on xml computer code and rss - really simple syndication - listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software which mr curry has pioneered. the latest files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically. mr curry records hosts edits and produce a daily minute podcast called the daily source code. he wants to make podcasting the next big thing and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry. i was always into technologies and wires he explains. my parents gave me the radio shack project kit which allows you to build an am transmitter and subsequently an fm transmitter. i had my mom drive me around the block see how far it would reach on the car radio. mr curry is american but he grew up in the netherlands where he hosted illegal pirate radio shows in the dutch capital. he tried university in the us and ended up back in holland where he hosted a music video show. he spent the next seven years in new york where he worked at mtv hosting the top video countdown but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet. at a certain point in i was driving in on a friday afternoon beautiful blue sky one of those beautiful days thinking this is so stupid. you know i m going do the top countdown take the cheque go home and sit on the internet until three in the morning. so after i finished the show i quit. i said on air it s been great i ve been here for seven years at that point there s something on the internet i ve got to go find it and i ll see you later. but mr curry s technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high-speed internet connections were becoming more widely available. the format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before. most importantly mr curry says people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing. listen to % of the radio that you hear today it s radio voices and it s fake it s just fake. he wanted to make it easier for people to find real voices on the internet. he wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like ipods. mr curry is not a computer programmer so he asked others to create one for him. no one did so he tried to write one himself. he finished it a few months ago and says it totally sucked. he put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it; the result is a work in progress called ipodder . doug kaye a california-based podcaster praises the former mtv vj for what he has done. adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem. ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the player he explains. people can wake up in the morning pick up their ipods as they go to work or before they go exercise and discover that there s all this new content automatically put onto their players. it is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in australia finland brazil even malaysia. one couple broadcasts theirs the dawn and drew show from wisconsin in the us sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed. topics range from the comfort of their bed to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners. already websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts. chris mcintyre runs podcast alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know-how to simply listen. if i were to tell my mom or my mother-in-law to copy an xml or rss file to their podcast aggregator they would think i was speaking a foreign language mr mcintyre says. along with technical challenges there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite albeit copyrighted music. some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the anti-radio into something that is more like conventional broadcasting. already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world. heineken is doing its own podcast now and so is playboy. for his part adam curry s pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be. he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences. he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which he says is a badge i ll wear with great honour. to be the johnny carson or ed sullivan of anything is wonderful. and you know what you don t need a hell of a lot of talent. you just have to be nice have your ears open and let people shine. and that s good for me. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.
2034,errors doomed first dome sale the initial attempt to sell the millennium dome failed due to a catalogue of errors a report by the government s finance watchdog says. the report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the millennium exhibition ended. the national audit office said the dome cost taxpayers £. to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. finally a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. more than £ could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in greenwich london. the nao report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the dome. deputy prime minister john prescott said a good deal had been secured. delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the millennium village and elsewhere on the peninsula he said. but edward leigh who is chairman of the commons public accounts committee warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the dome deal. he said: this report also shows that the first attempt to sell the dome proved a complete fiasco. every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. the process was confused and muddled. he added: four years after the millennium exhibition closed the government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that incredible as it may seem should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. however it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt. nao head sir john bourn said: in difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition english partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.
702,escaped prisoner report ordered first minister jack mcconnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded. michael ferguson escaped after being allowed out of the high-security carstairs unit. the snp s nicola sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave. the scottish executive said ministers would be notified but it would not be common practice to sign approval. an executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report. ministerial responsibility for carstairs rests with rhona brankin the deputy health minister. ms brankin said: the first minister has called for a review of what has happened we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this. ms sturgeon has written to mr mcconnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out. she said questions must be answered about his escape if the public is to be reassured about safety. police are still searching for ferguson who failed to return after a trip to east kilbride on monday. the scottish national party s parliamentary leader argued that under the law authorisation of ferguson s leave of absence would have come directly from ministers. she said: the scottish executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of mr ferguson was a matter for carstairs. however my understanding is that under the mental health legislation the decision to grant this patient - and any restricted patient - leave of absence would have required direct and specific authorisation by scottish ministers. she added: i have written to the first minister today asking for confirmation of that fact. i have also asked him to confirm which minister would routinely take decisions of this nature and what information they are based on. this is not an attempt to apportion blame but to ensure a better understanding of the decision making process in such important and sensitive cases. police said ferguson posed a danger to the public. bbc scotland political correspondent glenn campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation. he said: we understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for michael ferguson to be released unescorted from carstairs. the executive concedes that it is up to scottish ministers they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it. but at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised. scottish conservative leader david mcletchie said earlier it was almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen . the executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers . she said: ministers were told of that notified of it but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off. they do have statutory responsibility but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision. ferguson who slashed a man in a doctors surgery in coatbridge in had been out to see his fianc& annabella holmes whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in south lanarkshire. he is described as being tall slim with blond hair blue eyes and a fair complexion. ferguson was wearing a black jacket grey jeans black jumper and black shoes when he was last seen. he has multiple fading tattoos on his left hand and a very faded tear tattoo under his left eye. ms holmes is not missing but there have been no sightings of ferguson since monday. strathclyde police asked anyone who spots ferguson to contact sergeant keith mcdonald on .
1231,hollywood campaign hits websites movie studio efforts to stop pirated films being shared on peer-to-peer networks have claimed a high-profile victim. the campaign of legal action is thought to be behind the closure of the widely used suprnova.org website. the site was the most popular place for people swapping and sharing links for the bittorrent network. a recent study showed that more than half of the peer-to-peer traffic during june was for the bittorrent system. in a message posted on suprnova.org on sunday the site s controllers said the site was closing down for good in the way that we all know it . if the site did return the message said it would not be hosting any more torrent links. it continued: we are very sorry for this but there was no other way we have tried everything. the only parts that would keep going said the operators of the suprnova site were the discussion forums and net chat channels. the site is thought to have closed following an announcement by the motion picture association of america that it was launching legal action against those operating bittorrent servers rather than end users. because of the way that bittorrent works server sites do not host the actual file being shared instead they host a link that points people to others that have it. by targeting servers the mpaa hopes to cripple bittorrent s ability to share files. in the opening days of the mpaa campaign the organisation filed lawsuits against operators of bittorrent server site. the launching of the legal seems to be having an effect. phoenix torrents another popular bittorrent site has also decided to shut down and though it gave no reasons for the closure it is thought to be motivated by the threat of legal action. last week finnish police raided a bittorrent site based in the country that according to reports let users shared pirated films software music and games.
754,guantanamo man suing government a british terror suspect held in guantanamo bay for months plans to sue the government it is reported. martin mubanga claimed in the observer that an officer played a key role in consigning him to the us camp in cuba following his arrest in zambia. mr mubanga from wembley london said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp. the home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not well informed . mr mubanga who has dual british and zambian nationality was one of four britons who were released from the us camp in january. he said he was sent there after being interrogated by a british man who said he was from shortly after his arrest in zambia in march . mr mubanga said he had been in afghanistan and pakistan to study islam. but he said he was unable to return to the uk because he had lost his british passport and was travelling on his zambian passport instead. mr mubanga said the agent told him the passport had been found in a cave in afghanistan along with documents listing jewish groups in new york and suggested he had been on an al-qaeda reconnaissance mission. mr mubanga said the man and an american female defence official tried to recruit him as an agent but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to guantanamo bay. his lawyer louise christian said: we are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to guantanamo. and menzies campbell the liberal democrats foreign affairs spokesman said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved mr mubanga s transfer to guantanamo. but a foreign office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of british intelligence or security agencies. and home secretary charles clarke told bbc one s breakfast with frost: i m not organising a specific investigation into it. mr mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview. he told the observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last march only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years. he claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box naked except for boxer shorts. and he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot. mr mubanga who insists he does not feel bitter said: i ve lost three years of my life because i was a muslim. he added: the authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me. they ve made me what i am - even if i m not quite sure yet who that person is. the us government denied the claims saying it condemned and prohibited torture. in a statement it said: the department of defense has no doubt that mr mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war. he was detained to prevent him from fighting against the us and our allies in the war on terror. but fair trials abroad director stephen jakobi said there were similarities between mr mubanga s account and those of other guantanamo detainees. he said: the pattern is the same. the real problem is the concentration camp conditions in guantanamo. is [charles clarke] really pretending this is all made up mr mubanga and the three other freed british detainees were released without charge by uk police on their return from cuba.
1792,worldcom bosses $ payout ten former directors at worldcom have agreed to pay $ (£.) including $ from their own pockets to settle a class action lawsuit reports say. james wareham a lawyer representing one of the directors told reuters the had agreed to pay those who lost billions when the firm collapsed. the remaining $ will be paid by the directors insurers. but a spokesman for the prosecutor new york state comptroller alan hevesi said no formal agreement had been made. corporate governance experts said that if the directors do dip into their own pockets for the settlement it will set a new standard for the accountability of bosses when the firms they oversee face problems. directors very rarely pay said charles elson chairman of the center for corporate governance at the university of delaware. he added that the settlement sends a pretty strong shockwave through the director world . a formal agreement on the payout is expected to be signed on thursday in a us district court in manhattan. earlier the new york times had reported that the personal payments were required as part of any deal at the start of negotiations. the ten former outside directors are james allen judith areen carl aycock max bobbitt clifford alexander stiles kellett gordon macklin john porter lawrence tucker and the estate of john sidgmore who died last year. it has not yet been determined how much each director will have to pay. none of the former directors was a direct participant in the accounting machinations of the worldcom fraud said the wall street journal (wsj). two other outside former directors bert roberts and francesco galesi remain defendants in the lawsuit said the newspaper. according to the wsj which cites people familiar to the case the settling directors are expected to deny wrongdoing and state they are settling the case to eliminate the uncertainties and expense of further litigations. the second-largest us long-distance telecoms operator filed for bankruptcy in when an $ accounting scandal was unearthed. the company emerged from chapter protection last year and changed its name to mci inc. former worldcom chief executive bernard ebbers is to face trial this month on criminal charges that he oversaw the fraud.
1804,dublin hi-tech labs to shut down dublin s hi-tech research laboratory media labs europe is to shut down. the research centre which was started by the irish government and the massachusetts institute of technology was a hotbed for technology concepts. since its opening in the centre has developed ideas such as implants for teeth and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. the centre was supposed to be self-funded but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. in a statement media labs europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the irish government nor the prestigious us-based massachusetts institute of technology (mit) was willing to fund it. prime minister bertie ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies in an attempt to regenerate the area. about three dozen small firms were attracted to the area but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the labs long-term survival. the labs needed about million euros (us$ million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. in the end it was too deep and too long a recession said simon jones the labs managing director. ian pearson bt s futurologist told the bbc news website that the closure was a real shame . bt was just one of the companies that had worked with the labs looking at rfid tag developments and video conferencing. there were a lot of very talented creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. i have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost. noel dempsey the government s communications minister said mr ahern had been very committed to the project. he is i know very disappointed it has come to this. at the time it seemed to be the right thing to do he said. unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate. during its five years innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. in recent months patent applications had been filed by the labs. many concepts fed into science engineering and psychology as well as technology but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. the human connectedness group for example developed the iband a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. this information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. other projects looked at using other human senses like touch to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment or on the body itself. one project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. the labs set up in an old guinness brewery housed around people made up of staff researchers students collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. it is thought more than people will lose their jobs when the labs close on february. according to its latest accounts media lab europe said it spent . million euros (about us$. million) in and raised just . million euros (us$. million).
1115,blunkett sorry over murder plan david blunkett has apologised to mps after the home office announced prematurely via press release a review of murder laws. the home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a law commission report which branded the current murder law as a mess . he said the review would look at partial defences to murder including provocation and at mandatory sentences. the home office has already said the review will begin next year. on wednesday a home office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only england and wales. news of the review was released because it was thought mr blunkett would make the official announcement in a commons debate on wednesday. but the announcement never came with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. amid opposition anger mr blunkett had to answer an emergency question in parliament on thursday. he said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. shadow home secretary david davis welcomed his gracious apology and the review itself. but he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be dragged to face mps. in its report the law commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. the panel suggested different kinds of murders could be graded to recognise the seriousness of the offence. but the home office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. the commission an independent body including two judges a senior barrister and sentencing experts had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. but it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law. results of a consultation exercise showed respondents out of - among them judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was indefensible and should cease . a key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. the commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. but speaking after the report was published home office minister baroness scotland said: murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. where an offender is convicted of murder the court must pass a life sentence. the commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.
2125,analysis: no pain no gain he called it his masochism strategy in the run-up to the iraq war and now tony blair has signed up for another dose of pain. the idea is simple - the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of real voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras. the theory is that talking to the great british public even if they are the great unwashed is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians. it is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real people s concerns and - on occasions - of their outright fury. mr blair used the tactic before the iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election. labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin control freakery and over-slick presentation - sometimes from within the ranks of its own mps. tony blair himself has said people complain he does not listen. mr blair s latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on five television throughout wednesday. the trouble began on the wright stuff show with maria hutchings marching up to him saying tony that s rubbish as she tried to complain about her autistic son s school being threatened with closure. a few don t worries as mrs hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match - he spoke to her privately after the show. but that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce. writer neil coppendale from west sussex asked of the iraq war: tens of thousands of innocent men women and children died - how do you manage to sleep at night on immigration london teacher diane granger said: where are you going to put everyone and can you imagine even jeremy paxman putting the question posed by brighton nurse marion brown: would you wipe somebody s backside for £ mr blair tried to use the questioners first names - and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems. many of the newspapers have branded the exercise a pr stunt which backfired. indeed there is a danger mr blair simply ends up looking embattled . conservative michael howard and liberal democrat charles kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month. labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence. james humphreys ex-head of corporate communications at number says the strategy shows frustration with the media. they feel they don t get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion he says. there are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls he argues. the prime minister knows full well the potential hazards . he must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with sharron storer the birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the election campaign. all you do is walk around and make yourself known you don t do anything to help anybody she told mr blair before stomping off refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately. former downing street media chief alastair campbell has described the episode as a bit of a disaster as it meant the launch of labour s election manifesto received little coverage. but it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive not least because it coincided with john prescott s even more direct contact - when he punched an egg-throwing protester. former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public. the undoubted highlight of years of election phone-in shows was margaret thatcher discomfort on nationwide in when viewer diana gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the belgrano in the falklands war. john major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the election campaign with his famous soapbox. it may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added fizz to his campaign. in his memoirs he also argues the strategy contrasted with neil kinnock s contrived photo opportunities and attempts at an artful campaign. he wanted to look like a prime minister. i was prime minister and i wanted a flesh and blood fight says mr major. mr blair told prospective labour mps on thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment . but he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips. mr blair recalls how bill clinton once advised him: always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day. his hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for labour the old maxim: no pain no gain.
55,vouchers to cut winter deaths pensioners are being promised energy savings by the liberal democrats as snow and cold temperatures continue. the party says the plans could save the average pensioner £ every year and cut winter deaths. the government gives £ for winter fuel to households with people over or £ where people are over . the tories promise to keep the payments. the lib dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation. shadow local government secretary ed davey said: the current scheme has helped some older people but this new liberal democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year. the vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes. the plan would boost energy conservation says the party - and insulation could save £ every year for pensioner households so using the money more intelligently than at present.
1375,liberian economy starts to grow the liberian economy started to grow in but sustained and deep reform efforts are needed to ensure long term growth the international monetary fund (imf) has said. an imf mission made the comments in a report published following days of talks with the transition government. the imf said that according to data provided by the liberians the country s gdp rose by % in after a % decline in . liberia is recovering from a -year civil war that came to an end in . the power-sharing national transition government of liberia will remain in place until elections on october the first presidential and parliamentary ballots since the conflict ended. the imf said liberia s economy started to grow last year thanks to a continued strong recovery in rubber production domestic manufacturing and local services including post-conflict reconstruction . the imf however remains cautious about what it sees as a lack of transparency in government actions. in particular it pointed to mystery surrounding the sale of iron ore stockpiles and the alleged disappearance of some import and export permits. these matters are now being investigated by the liberian authorities and the imf has called for their findings to be made public. the imf also said it was crucial that the central bank of liberia be strengthened the national budget be effectively managed and a sound economic basis built to allow the country s large external debt to be addressed. the imf team stands ready to assist the (liberian) authorities in strengthening the areas mentioned said the report. the team agreed with the (liberian) authorities that the period until elections and the inauguration of a new government will pose exceptional challenges to fiscal management and expresses its willingness to provide...continued support.

1154,chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters warning the stakes are too high to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election. the chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on may - would give a clear and fundamental choice between labour investment and tory cuts. he told his party s spring conference the tories must not be allowed to win. the conservatives and lib dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under labour. to a packed audience at gateshead s sage centre mr brown accused shadow chancellor oliver letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher gp and nurse in the country. laying into the conservative s record in government he said: i give you this promise - with labour britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and % inflation % interest rates £ in lost reserves repossessed one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. never again tory boom and bust. this will be the central dividing line at the election between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of £ in our services and a labour government taking britain forward which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals schools and public services and i am proud to say spend by £ more. turning to the economy the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power. he also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. and he promised help to get young people on the property ladder. my message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto he said. and the next labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers initiative. in the speech which prompted a standing ovation he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. he also highlighted plans for % debt relief for the world s poorest countries a national minimum wage for and -year-olds the creation of a network of children s centres and flexibility in maternity leave. responding to the speech shadow chief secretary to the treasury george osborne said: this was more talk from gordon brown. we ve heard it all before. instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past. he completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans. there will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the conservatives or more waste and higher taxes under tony blair and gordon brown. liberal democrat shadow chancellor vince cable warned the picture was not as rosy as mr brown would like to portray it. for all his trumpeting of labour s management of the economy gordon brown s record is very mixed he said. gordon brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy a system which subjects millions of people to means testing and a system of taxation which is extremely complex. for all his positive words gordon brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation. also in gateshead the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail text message and telephone as part of labour s attempt to engage the public in their campaign. mr blair told the audience he believed the iraq war would have made britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible but not before the job was done. he also said he wanted to carry on as pm because i still think that there are big changes our country needs .

428,china suspends power projects china has ordered a halt to construction work on big power stations including two at the three gorges dam on environmental grounds. the move is a surprising one because china is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. last year provinces suffered black outs. the state environmental protection agency said the projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river. construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first approval next said sepa vice-director pan yue in a statement on the agency s website. some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits but others would be cancelled he said. altogether the agency ordered projects halted. other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in fujian. the bulk of the list was made up of new power plants with some extensions to existing ones. the stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government s battle to control projects licensed by local officials. however previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity such as steel and cement. the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. in china increased its generating capacity by .% or megawatts (mw). the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project designed to produce mw of electricity. it is being built on the jinshajiang - or river of golden sand as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. second and third on the agency s list were two power stations being built at the $ three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground mw power plant and a mw plant. the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. it has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china. in april central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby nu river which is part of a united nations world heritage site the three parallel rivers site which covers the yangtze mekong and nu (also known as the salween) according to the uk-published china review. that move reportedly followed a protest from the thai government about the downstream impact of the dams and a critical documentary made by chinese journalists. china s energy shortage influenced global prices for oil coal and shipping last year.

630,putting a face to big brother literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets. imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist. together with speech and voice recognition systems they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. some of these ideas have been showcased at the london s science museum as part of its future face exhibition. one such avatar is jeremiah. it is a virtual man which you can download for free and install in your computer. his creator richard bowden lecturer at the centre for vision speech and signal processing at the university of surrey refers to jeremiah as him rather than it. jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. he is very childlike he likes visual stimulus he told the bbc news website. when he sees children running and laughing and waving at him he smiles at them. if you ignore him he gets angry. if you leave he gets sad. and you can also even surprise him. jeremiah is not actually intelligent. it works on vision reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system. it is not able to talk or to hear you at least not yet. the surrey team is already working on jeremiah s next version that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: finn the fish. i am interested in the interaction providing the ability of a system to watch what s going on and make decisions based on that explained dr bowden. the research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets. experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices such as a virtual human could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos. if you get up at three o clock in the morning and you go downstairs there are probably two things you are going to do: either going to the bathroom or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea said dr bowden. now if the system can watch your behaviour over time it can learn this so it would predict what you are going to do turn on the lights for you or before you even get to the kettle it could have switched it on. you might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left. this might sound like a scary vision of an orwellian future. but it might all depend on the face that is watching you. when we put the surveillance cameras in our centre a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them said dr bowden. but when jeremiah s camera went in nobody minded because although it s still watching them they could see what it was watching.

1956,trial date is set for balco case a us judge has set a preliminary trial date for the balco steroid distribution case which has rocked athletics. us district court judge susan ilston rejected an attempt by the defence team to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in san francisco. and she set a march date for the case of the four men accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes to be heard. a firm decision on whether the trial takes place is expected in january. the judge said that she may conduct hearings in january into whether federal agents illegally searched the balco headquarters and wrongfully obtained statements from the company s founder victor conte and its vice-president james valente. the two men - along with personal trainer greg anderson and athletics coach remy korchemny - were all indicted earlier this year but have pleaded their innocence. the outcome of those hearings could result in some or all of the charges being dismissed. conte said that he would be telling his side of the story on an american tv show on friday. the world deserves to know the truth about performance-enhancing drugs he said. balco (the bay area laboratory cooperative) is the company at the centre of the scandal. the company has been accused by the united states anti-doping agency (usada) of being the source of the banned steroid thg and modafinil. the usada claims that athletes have received sanctions for testing positive for thg and modafinil. former double world champion kelli white and olympic relay star alvin harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation. britain s former european champion dwain chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for thg in an out-of-competition test in .

864,uk gets official virus alert site a rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the uk government. the service it safe will issue warnings about damaging viruses software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones. alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves. the service will be free and those who sign up can get e-mail or text alerts. the scheme is aimed at home users and small businesses. the government estimates it will issue security alerts about six to times a year based on previous experience of virus outbreaks. there is a clear need for easy-to-understand and simple independent advice for non-technically minded people who use computers either at home or at work said home office minister hazel blears. the purpose of this new government service is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with them easily and effectively without causing alarm. those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people. full-time staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people between alerts the service will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use their computers and phones. it safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items safe said roger cumming director of the national infrastructure security coordination centre (niscc). the niscc which is running the service also stressed that those signing up would still need to use anti-virus software firewalls and software updates to stay secure. warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is how it affects them and what they can do to avoid trouble. alerts will not be issued unless users can do something to protect themselves against the threat. this might include downloading an update from an anti-virus vendor or updating software to close loopholes and fix vulnerabilities. however no software patches or programs will actually be dispensed through the site. the alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms. the niscc spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets. government statistics show that more than half of all uk households own a home computer. it was estimated that almost million of these were able to access the internet in . the launch comes as the number of viruses and other malicious programs in existence is reaching unprecedented numbers. in september the number of malicious programs circulating topped the mark. some fear that this figure could hit by september . the creation of the national alert service follows similar efforts in the netherlands and us. the national alerting service for the netherlands (aka de waarschuwingsdienst) and the us national cyber alerting service also tell citizens of serious security threats.
2007,new delay hits eu software laws a fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computer-based inventions. the draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at a brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. there was at one point the intention to put the item on today s agenda. but in the end we could not put it on an eu spokesman told the reuters agency. he added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law. in december poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. poland is a large eu member so its backing for the legislation is vital. the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its one-click shopping service. critics say a similar model in europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. but supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.
1401,brazil plays down varig rescue the brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country s biggest airline. brazil s airport authority chief carlos wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save varig brazil s flagship airline. however the country s vice president jose alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of . billion reais ($. or £.). asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country s congress to discuss the airline s crisis mr alencar replied: no i don t think so. we will see. earlier mr wilson had said that president luiz inacio lula da silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week. in practice it will be an intervention although this is not the technical name used he said. an intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances. for that to happen varig s main shareholder the non-profit ruben berta foundation which represents the airline s employees would have to be removed mr wilson said. however no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying he added. varig which operates in countries apart from brazil has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country s economic downturn. the depreciation of brazil s currency has had a direct impact on the airline s dollar debt as well as some of its costs. business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the brazilian economy. the airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. on tuesday the courts awarded varig reais ($) after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from to . but the government can appeal the decision.
2035,what now for kelly holmes last april kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the and at the olympics. it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them. four months later holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes. with so much time spent in the spotlight holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt. and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead the -year-old has repeatedly chosen to tick the don t know box. holmes has now pulled out of this weekend s european indoor championships where she was selected for both the and because of a hamstring injury. but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore well it s a lot easier being the double olympic champion being feted by everybody than training to be at the top in middle distance running points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram. you have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you re very talented. holmes drive and determination have always been unquestionable - that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed. but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself. will i have as much commitment desire and energy to go through a major championship holmes asked in the new year. that is what i don t know. at holmes will also be aware that time is running out. us and legend michael johnson a five-time olympic gold medallist retired shortly after his birthday as did britain s double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson. the physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for holmes who has already admitted she doesn t like the training anymore. whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on. holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten. unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race she will not step onto the track. but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer there are more prizes up for grabs. the day after completing her double in athens the -year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title. holmes wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki. there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard she trains nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens. on the other hand if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn t they be at least shared and celebrated you don t get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion agreed cram. you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it s a fantastic feeling. i think deep down kelly wants to run. i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain. athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look kelly holmes tearing up the track again. after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire. so why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where when or whether to even bother competing again that s just kelly explains cram. she s always been like that. she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next. she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it s headline news. kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions whether she can be competitive if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line. and if she decides not to run again no-one is going to turn round and say you re making the wrong decision.
958,japan economy slides to recession the japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade. gross domestic product fell by .% in the last three months of . the fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending and follows similar falls in gdp in the two previous quarters. the tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. on wednesday the government revised growth figures from earlier in which when taking into account performance in the most recent period effectively tips japan into recession. a previous estimate of .% growth between july and september was downgraded to a .% decline. a recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth although the japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy. figures released by the government s cabinet office showed that gdp on an annualised basis fell .% in the last three months of . however politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. the economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture it is in a recovery stage said economic and fiscal policy minister heizo takenaka. gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country. the economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at gdp alone mr takenaka stressed. ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that japan s largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. japan s economy grew .% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of .% in . however the economy s fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. the results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn t be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy said naoki iizuka senior economist at the dai-ichi life research institute. japan s economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.
650,wales silent on grand slam talk rhys williams says wales are still not thinking of winning the grand slam despite a third six nations win. that s the last thing on our minds at the moment said williams a second- half replacement in saturday s - win over france in paris. we all realise how difficult a task it is to go up to scotland and beat them. we ve come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we ll worry about ireland hopefully after we ve beaten scotland. with captain gareth thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far. kevin morgan is probably favourite to replace thomas at full-back leaving williams and hal luscombe to battle for the right wing berth. a hamstring injury denied luscombe the opportunity to make a third successive start but the dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to murrayfield on march. hooker robin mcbryde is doubtful after picking up a knee injury in paris but centre sonny parker and flanker colin charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection. said wales assistant coach scott johnson: they ve worked through the weekend and the reports are a bit more positive. so we re getting a couple back and that adds to the depth of the squad. scotland secured their first win of the campaign on saturday by grinding out an - win over italy. matt williams side has shown little in attack but johnson insisted the scots will be difficult opposition to break down. italy are really brave opposition and sometimes it s very hard to win he said. so an ugly win can be just as effective as a or point victory. scotland are a hard side and very underrated so we re not taking anything for granted. we re not basking in the glory of winning our first three games. we ve got to be diligent in our preparation. that s my job and we ve got to make sure we re focused.

1660,debate needed on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet the elections watchdog has said. fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £ cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. there were almost £ in reported donations to political parties in and with nearly £ of them from individual gifts worth more than £. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible says its report. if there was to be a cap it should be £ - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £ in donations between and . even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £ so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters. the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates while cutting national spending limits from £ to £. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said: there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations. he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.

56,ukraine trims privatisation check ukraine is to review dozens of state asset sales as the country s new administration tackles corruption. the figure announced by president viktor yushchenko is less than the cases mentioned last week but will cover many of the biggest deals. ukraine recently ousted long-serving leader leonid kuchma and has said it wants closer european union links. in a separate statement the eu said that the us should back ukraine s entry into the world trade organisation. the comments came as viktor yushchenko prepared to head to brussels to meet with us president george w bush and other north atlantic treaty organisation (nato) leaders. he is the only non-nato member leader invited to attend the summit. mr yushchenko recently defeated moscow-backed presidential candidate and prime minister viktor yanukovych at the polls and has made no secret of his wish to fight corruption and make ukraine more transparent. earlier this month new prime minister yulia tymoshenko said as many as firms may have their privatisations put under the spotlight. her comments raised concerns among a number of investors and mr yushchenko was seen on monday as trying to soothe their frayed nerves. we acknowledge that business in ukraine is now shaped and % of privatisations were carried out according to the law mr yushchenko said on monday. we have trust in this business and want to defend it by law he continued adding that any review would focus on dozens of companies not hundreds or thousands . he cited last year s sale of ukrainian steel producer krivorizhstal as one that had raised concerns. it was sold in june to a consortium that included viktor pinchuk son-in-law of former-president kuchma and rinat akhmetov the country s richest man for $ (£) - despite other higher offers. vice-prime minister oleg rybachuk called on the eu to recognise the steps that ukraine was taking fearing that should the country not be rewarded for its efforts there may be a backlash against closer relations with brussels. he said that while he understood that ukraine was not ready for eu membership the country needed to see progress on topics such as trade and visa requirements. we deserve an honest response mr rybachuk told the associated press in an interview. we understand the difficulties. we refuse to understand double standards. ukraine may find it has a sympathetic ear in brussels the eu has reiterated that we support (ukraine s) fast accession to the wto and if possible we would like that to happen some time during the year said claude veron-reville a spokesman for eu trade commissioner peter mandelson. we have said as much to the americans. we feel that it is important for us all to pull together for ukraine to be allowed into the wto. mr yushchenko was careful not to turn his back on russia which borders the country to the east saying it was important to maintain pragmatic ties with moscow. russia is ukraine s eternal strategic partner mr yushchenko said.

1364,evil twin fear for wireless net people using wireless high-speed net (wi-fi) are being warned about fake hotspots or access points. the latest threat nicknamed evil twins pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations say cranfield university experts. once logged onto an evil twin sensitive data can be intercepted. wi-fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability. london leads the global wi-fi hotspots league with more than . the number of hotspots is expected to reach by according to analysts. users need to be wary of using their wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature said professor brian collins head of information systems at cranfield university. users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi-fi device has its security measures activated he added. bt openzone which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the uk told the bbc news website that it made every effort to make its wi-fi secure. naturally people may have security concerns said chris clark chief executive for bt s wireless broadband. but wi-fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet like broadband or dial-up. he said bt openzone as well as others have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot. this means that users personal information and data logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure said mr clark. in the vast majority of cases base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible said dr nobles. cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client. anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin. cybercriminals don t have to be that clever to carry out such an attack said dr phil nobles a wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield. because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency. although wi-fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high-speed net on the move there have been fears over how secure it is. some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security. a wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company s computer system. public wi-fi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud are accessible after users sign up and pay for use. but many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be sniffed out and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment. bt advises that customers should change all default settings make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly said mr clark. we also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted. dr nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the science museum s dana centre in london on thursday.

313,speech takes on search engines a scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results. called speegle it has the look and feel of a normal search engine with the added feature of being able to read out the results. scottish speech technology firm cec systems launched the site in november. but experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments. the edinburgh-based firm cec has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search. the ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web. according to search engine ask jeeves around % of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net. people visiting speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the bbc and reuters. it is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad said speegle founder gordon renton. the system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else. we are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people although the royal national institute of the blind (rnib) is looking at the technology he added. but julie howell digital policy manager at the rnib expressed doubts over whether speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people s experience of the web. there are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be she said. blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way she added. the site uses a technology dubbed panavox which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech. in the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but cec says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial-up connections. visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known if silent search engine google. google has no connection with speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments said mr renton. it is not a rip-off. we are doing something that google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery he said. speegle is proving popular with those learning english in countries such as japan and china. the site is bombarded by people just listening to the words. the repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots said mr renton.
1566,creator of first apple mac dies jef raskin head of the team behind the first macintosh computer has died. mr raskin was one of the first employees at apple and made many of the design decisions that made the mac so distinctive when it was first released. he led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking. the release of the mac reflected mr raskin s belief that good design should make computers easy to use. mr raskin joined apple in as employee number initially to lead the company s publications department. however in he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use. the result was the macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing clicking and dragging. although now in common use in almost all computers these methods were pioneering when first used in the macintosh. the gui was developed by xerox parc and used in its star machine. but the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by apple in its pioneering lisa computer. his role on the macintosh was the initiator of the project so it wouldn t be here if it weren t for him said andy hertzfeld an early macintosh team member. although mr raskin drove the team that created the macintosh he did not stay at apple to see it released. in he was removed from the project following a dispute with apple s mercurial boss steve jobs. in mr raskin left apple entirely. the macintosh was reputedly named after mr raskin s favourite apple though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. after leaving apple mr raskin founded another company called information appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. he was also an accomplished musician played three instruments and conducted san francisco s chamber opera society. mr raskin was diagnosed in december with pancreatic cancer and died on february at his home in california.
1999,mcleish ready for criticism rangers manager alex mcleish accepts he is going to be criticised after their disastrous uefa cup exit at the hands of auxerre at ibrox on wednesday. mcleish told bbc radio five live: we were in pole position to get through to the next stage but we blew it we absolutely blew it. there s no use burying your head in the sand we know we are going to get a lot of criticism. we have to take it as we have done in the past and we must now bounce back. mcleish admitted his team s defending was amateurish after watching them lose - to guy roux s french side. i m very disappointed because we didn t give ourselves a chance losing the first goal from our own corner. it was amateur he added. the early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half. it s difficult to take positives from the game. we ve let the fans down.
700,blunkett unveils policing plans people could be given the mobile phone number of their local bobby under an overhaul of policing in england and wales unveiled by david blunkett. the plans include a dedicated policing team for each neighbourhood and a point compulsory customer charter. the home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police. local people would also be able to trigger action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done. local councillors would have to show certain conditions had been met before invoking the power. and police could refuse the request if the complaints were frivolous would only cause annoyance or would pose too heavy a burden on resources. mr blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police. the best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms he said but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed. the home secretary s powers to suspend or sack chief constables are being reviewed after mr blunkett s battle with humberside chief david westwood over intelligence failures on soham murderer ian huntley. opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork. tory spokesman david davis said the proposals were little more than a taxpayer-funded pr exercise ahead of a general election predicted for next may. police forces were already buried under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them said mr davis. earlier lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police. but these measures will only work if they re matched with a cut in the amount of paperwork - and investment in modern equipment to keep the police out on the streets. before delivering a statement to mps mr blunkett was joined by tony blair at welling school in south east london which is at the heart of a community policing initiative. mr blunkett said he wanted to go back to a time when i was very young when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work . the prime minister said the law-abiding citizen should be in charge of the community and not the minority who want to cause trouble . mr blunkett already boasts about producing record police numbers. he has also started to recruit community support officers (csos) and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects. an extra £ was promised on tuesday so new csos can be recruited now rather than next year. within two years every force will be expected to keep to a coppers contract on what kind of service the public can expect. a mori poll this summer suggested policing unlike health and education was the one major public service where people were less satisfied the more contact they had with it. the plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted. there will also be specific exercises to encourage black and asian people to join the police at senior ranks.
148,moya emotional at davis cup win carlos moya described spain s davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usa s challenge in seville. moya made up for missing spain s victory through injury by beating roddick - - (-) - (-) to give the hosts an unassailable - lead. i have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day said moya. all my energy has been focused on today. what i have lived today i do not think i will live again. spain s only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia when they beat australia. and moya nicknamed charly admitted: the davis cup is my dream and i was a bit nervous at the outset. some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way. it helps me reach my goals if i am obsessed. it s really incredible - to get the winning point is really something. spanish captain jordi arrese said: charly played a great game. it was his opportunity and he hasn t let us down. he had lost three times to roddick and this was his day to beat him. he had been waiting years to be in this position. spain s victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal who beat roddick in the opening singles. aged years and days the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup. what a great way to finish the year said nadal afterwards. us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better. obviously it s unrealistic to say that we re going to just start playing constantly on clay with the schedule. but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff said mcenroe. roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of seville s olympic stadium. it s just tough because i felt like i was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world said the american. i had my chances and just didn t convert them. the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. they came out took care of business and they beat us. it s as simple as that.
956,web radio takes spanish rap global spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish-language music. but what you will not find is much spanish-language hip-hop. hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish-speaking world but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. but now a us company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico s hottest hip-hop acts. they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey. but most mexican hip-hop fans not to mention fans in most of the spanish-speaking world rarely get a chance to hear the group s tracks on the radio. you can t really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in spanish... it s just not accessible says manuel millan a native of san diego california. it s really hard for the spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world. millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally. mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. so millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. the name says it all: it is web-based radio devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. the site which is in both in english and spanish is meant to be easy to navigate. all the user has to do is download a media player. there are no djs. it is just music streamed over the net for free. suddenly with the help of the website los caballeros de plan g are producing export quality rap. the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now. the genre is in what millan calls its infant stage . but the production values are improving and artists such as argentina s mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better. mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. he s considered the eminem of argentina and the latin american hip-hop scene millan says. he really hasn t had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world but he s definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world. currently the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com s top as is cuban artist papo record. every country s got it s own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs millan says. latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world. right now mexico leads the way accounting for about % of listeners. but web surfers in spain are logging in as well - about % of the web station s traffic comes from there. that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish-language rap and hip-hop. millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. that might be changing though as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences. but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com s top . his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in spain. on his track uno contra veinte emcees or one against emcees tote king shows he is well aware of that fact. it s basically him bragging that he s one of the best emcees in spain right now millan says. and it s pretty much true. he has the tightest productions and his rap flow is impeccable it s amazing. latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip-hop and rap. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.
1345,blair sets date for africa report the commission for africa s report will be released on march - comic relief day tony blair has said. july s summit in gleneagles in perthshire - chaired by the prime minister - will use the report as the basis for talks on africa. the announcement followed the final meeting of the commission - which includes singer bob geldof - in london. as well as more aid fairer trade and less debt the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in africa. mr blair told a news conference: it will be a report that s brutally frank about the reality but i hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there. it s an ambitious project we have set ourselves and you will have to judge on its outcome when we publish it. mr blair has vowed to put africa at the top of his agenda during his time at the helm of the . he acknowledged he would have a a job of persuading to do on other nations to get the necessary commitment to debt relief. bob geldof in characteristically blunt style promised that the commission would not just be a talking shop but would deliver radical new thinking to change direction for africa. the former rock star s presence on the commission has been interpreted as a sign that it will be uncompromising in its demands. the people involved include two african government leaders and a range of other african politicians as well as experts from some other developed countries.
1788,muslim group attacks tv drama a british muslim group has criticised the new series of us drama which is about to be aired on sky one claiming it portrays islam unfairly. the muslim council of britain has complained to broadcasting watchdog ofcom. it says the programme breaches editorial guidelines. the group s members met with sky executives on tuesday after viewing previews of the first five episodes. the drama now in its fourth series begins on sunday evening. the new series portrays a muslim family as a sleeper terrorist cell. the muslim council of britain said in a statement: we are greatly concerned by the unremittingly hostile and unbalanced portrayal of muslims in this series of based upon a preview of the first five episodes that we have seen. there is not a single positive muslim character in the storyline to date. at a time when negative stereotypes of muslims are on the increase we feel that sky - as a major uk broadcaster - has a responsibility to challenge these insidious views not help to reinforce them. but sky denied the programme breached broadcasting guidelines. a spokesperson said: during a useful meeting yesterday sky listened to the concerns raised by representatives of the council. sky does not believe that the episodes that it has reviewed to date breach ofcom s programme code. fox tv which shows the series in the us is broadcasting public service announcements showing muslims in a positive light after complaints about the series.
518,yukos drops banks from court bid russian oil company yukos has dropped the threat of legal action against five banks it had accused of involvement in the sale of its key yugansk unit. state-owned rosneft bought the unit for $. (£) after yukos was forced to sell assets to meet a $. tax bill. yukos says the sale was illegal and is pursuing damages in a us court. its lawyers now accept abn amro bnp paribas calyon jp morgan chase bank and dresdner kleinwort wasserstein were not involved in the sale financing. however yukos still has an outstanding complaint against deutsche bank which it alleges to be the leader of a consortium that was behind a bid for yugansk by state gas monopoly gazprom. the company has also accused gazprom the russian federation and two other russian firms. gazprom had been expected to win the december auction but ended up not bidding. yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. the firm whose finance chief is now based in the us filed for bankruptcy in houston texas and sought a court injunction against the sale. but deutsche bank has suggested yukos artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset. a hearing scheduled for february and will rule on whether the us court has jurisdiction in the case.
1035,correction agency plans dropped plans to create a single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped. the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments. the national correctional agency would have provided a one-stop justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition. instead scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending. the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending. scotland s reoffending rate is high with more than % of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail. this is leading to an ever-expanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem. ministers thought merging the prison service with the council-controlled criminal justice social work departments which provide community sentences might have provided an answer. however following a consultation on the idea justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans. instead ms jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system. she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday aiming to break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community . the new measures will place a new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships. a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the sps s role and performance in reducing reoffending. the minister said: better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there. communities who are paying the price for this reoffending - both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs - expect better. it costs the taxpayer £ a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing. taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison. therefore as we continue to invest in the service it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves to ministers and to parliament.
1990,tories opposing -hour drinking the tories say plans to extend pub opening times should be put on hold until binge drinking is under control despite backing a law change last year. spokesman david davis said ministers had failed to make his party aware of concern among senior police that plans would cause more anti-social behaviour. notts police chief steve green said innocent people would suffer. but culture secretary tessa jowell said a delay would be disastrous and she accused the tories of opportunism. the government would go ahead with the changes which would give police more power to tackle excessive drinking she added. earlier chief constable green questioned how his officers would be able to practically apply powers allowing them to shut down problem premises. if you look at the market square in nottingham if a fight takes place which licensed premises do you go and lay the responsibilty at the door of he asked on bbc radio s world at one programme. he warned that if drinking establishments were allowed to open until three or four in the morning the police would have to take officers off day shifts in order to do their job effectively at night. earlier this year the royal college of physicians said it opposed the plan to extend drinking hours when there was already an epidemic of binge drinking. minister richard caborn said the government was tackling the causes and the symptoms of the problem by allowing more powers to close down problem premises. it is hoped that allowing pubs and clubs to stay open longer will stagger closing times and end the current situation where drinkers spill on to the streets all at once. earlier tony blair defended the plans against criticism from one of his own backbenchers. my view of this is very clear: we should have the same flexibility that other countries have and then we should come down really hard on those who abuse that freedom and don t show the responsibility he told mps. the law-abiding majority who want the ability after going to the cinema or theatre say to have a drink at the time they want should not be inconvenienced we shouldn t have to have restrictions that no other city in europe has just in order to do something for that tiny minority who abuse alcohol who go out and fight and cause disturbances. to take away that ability for all the population - even the vast majority who are law abiding - is not in my view sensible. this week a judge claimed easy access to drink was breeding urban savages and turning town centres into no go areas. judge charles harris qc made his remarks as he sentenced three men for assaults carried out while drunk and high on drugs after a night out.

53,pernod takeover talk lifts domecq shares in uk drinks and food firm allied domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by france s pernod ricard. reports in the wall street journal and the financial times suggested that the french spirits firm is considering a bid but has yet to contact its target. allied domecq shares in london rose % by gmt while pernod shares in paris slipped .%. pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics. pernod s last major purchase was a third of us giant seagram in the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms. the other two-thirds of seagram was bought by market leader diageo. in terms of market value pernod - at . euros ($.) - is about % smaller than allied domecq which has a capitalisation of £.

1824,howard and blair tax pledge clash tony blair has said voters will have to wait for labour s manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax. the premier was responding to a challenge from tory leader michael howard who said labour would raise taxes in its post-election budget. mr blair derided tory claims they could cut £ in wasteful spending saying the party had got its sums wrong. the two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the pre-election period. mr howard told mps that every independent expert from the international monetary fund to the institute of fiscal studies had suggested the government was spending more than it is raising and a labour chancellor would have to put up taxes . mr blair replied: i think they are wrong for this very simple reason: that the treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right. the tories on monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth £ although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced. they also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services. labour and the liberal democrats have said the party s sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. but mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes. the liberal democrats have also launched their pre-election platform with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the authentic opposition particularly on the iraq war council tax and university tuition fees. labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a fraudulent prospectus .

1550,latest opera browser gets vocal net browser opera . due for official release at the end of next month will be the most accessible browser on the market according to its authors. the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. the voice features based on ibm technology are currently only available in the windows version. opera can also magnify text by up to times and users can create style sheets its developers say. this will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone said opera spokeswoman berit hanson. so we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users. another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling. the company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using opera with a handheld device. the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural said ms hanson. people are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard so this makes the web a more hands-free experience. unlike commercially available voice recognition software opera does not have to be trained to recognise an individual voice. around voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. the voice recognition function is currently only available in english. opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from norwegian telecoms company telenor. its browser is used by an estimated million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.
2087,cyber criminals step up the pace so-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in say security experts. the number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than months. in it detected more than million phishing e-mail messages. other statistics show that in % of all e-mail was spam and one in messages were infected with a virus. in its end-of-year report messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. in september messagelabs caught only phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. but by september it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. worryingly said the firm phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data. older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. e-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity said mark sunner chief technology officer at messagelabs. in just months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online he said. mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed indicating a shift from the random scattergun approach to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses he said. although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. one of the biggest outbreaks took place in january when the mydoom virus started circulating. to date the company has caught more than million copies of the virus. also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. in only % of messages were spam. but by the end of almost three-quarters of messages were junk.
1869,ferrero eyes return to top form former world number one juan carlos ferrero insists he can get back to his best despite a tough start to . the french open champion has slipped to in the world after a year of illness and injuries in but is confident that his form will return. i don t know when it is going to happen ferrero told bbc sport. but i have a lot of confidence in me that i will be the same juan carlos as i was before and very soon. i feel % again mentally. the -year-old spaniard joins a top field for the abn amro world tennis tournament in rotterdam this week as he looks to add to just two wins in . he opens against rainer schuettler and potentially faces fourth seed david nalbandian in the second round. because i m no longer seeded it s tougher ferrero admitted. i had to play against joachim johansson in the first round last week in marseille. in the past when i was a top seed i would have played a match like that in the quarters or semi-finals. this is the big difference but i have to do it to get higher in the rankings. despite this ferrero insists he is feeling positive after chicken pox and a rib injury destroyed last season. physically i am % since december of last year said ferrero. i was working very hard before the davis cup final to prepare and i ve felt % from then until now. the difficult moments were when i knew that i had the chicken pox and that it would take two or three months to recover. i had to start from zero again physically because the virus left me at zero per cent. when i started to come back i had my rib broken when i fell on court and that was another two months out. those five months were pretty difficult for me. among the low points of a difficult year for ferrero was the decision of spain captain jordi arrese to drop him for the davis cup final against the usa. it was difficult because i had been playing well for the whole year and the coaches told me that i would play said ferrero. but then i had some problems with my hand two days before the friday matches so they decided to choose nadal instead. it was difficult for me not to be in the friday matches but i had to understand. inside me i wanted to play but this was the decision of the captain and they had to make it.
1468,election could be terror target terrorists might try to target the uk in the run-up to the election london s most senior police officer has said. sir ian blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the madrid bomb on spain s general election last year. other potential targets were the royal wedding and the uk s presidency of the european union and he said. he refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack. no was similarly cautious but said the threat was real. the comments come after tony blair defended his controversial anti-terror proposals warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting. sir ian told a meeting of the metropolitan police authority it would be unwise to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack. but he said: terrorists have long memories. they understand what happened in madrid and know what the impact of that was on the spanish electorate. this year we are responsible for the eu presidency presidency of the a royal wedding and a general election. there are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with. sir ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians not the police who would enforce any new powers. home secretary charles clarke has also warned that a madrid-style pre-election bombing could happen in the uk too. asked about sir ian s comments the prime minister s official spokesman said: we believe the threat is real. the spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign. he said no did not disclose any security advice they received. earlier writing in the daily telegraph the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were difficult issues for any government . the commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition with the government s majority more than halved as labour rebels joined tory and lib dem opposition. but mr blair insisted: there is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack. tory leader michael howard has accused mr blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of using national security for political point scoring . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy says that the plan is a further example of labour s authoritarian response to crises. the prevention of terrorism bill proposes control orders which as well as house arrest could impose curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against. but critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders. the plans face further commons scrutiny on monday before passing to the lords.
919,eu referendum could cost £ it could cost £ to run a uk referendum on the european constitution ministers have revealed. in a written parliamentary answer constitutional affairs minister chris leslie said the poll was likely to cost the same as a general election. mr leslie said the cost could not be compared with the only previous british referendum held years ago. ministers say the constitution would make the european union work better but critics fear creating a super state . labour mp john cryer whose question revealed the price estimate said the cost surprised him but was not a central factor as it was important people had their say. but he said it would have been better to have rejected the constitution so avoiding the need for a referendum. the election cost £. no date for the vote has been set but foreign secretary jack straw has suggested it is unlikely to be held until early - after the predicted date for the next election. most voters said the uk should stay in the common market in the referendum.

206,lib dems highlight problem debt people vulnerable to problem debts should be afforded greater protection from banks aggressively promoting financial products the lib dems say. vincent cable says one in eight households already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rates or unemployment. the lib dems treasury spokesman is unveiling a policy aimed at the issue. he wants to see proper health checks when loans are marketed so people know to take out payment protection. were economic conditions to deteriorate at all large numbers of people could be affected because they have borrowed to the limit mr cable told bbc news. banks are very aggressively promoting debt in many cases there is a bigger problem ahead. mr cable said the government s consumer credit bill would target some of the extreme problems such as loan sharking but ministers had been a bit complacent about the wider issue of debt levels. he said much of the payment protection currently available was extremely expensive and there were lots of exclusions . mr cable added that the office of fair trading should investigate the market. lib dem leader charles kennedy meanwhile is in the middle of a tour of the uk aimed at persuading voters his is the real opposition . mr kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives and urban areas traditionally associated with labour. labour say a lib dem vote could let the tories in while the tories say the lib dems would mean higher taxes soft crime laws more power to europe . mr kennedy s tour comes as he labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election widely expected to be held on may. the liberal democrats say in the northern cities the race is between them and labour while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the tories. speaking to the bbc s westminster hour on sunday mr kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for may - would be much more unpredictable than any others in recent experience . and he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in by the back door . if you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections the liberal democrats have demonstrated that not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position but we can go on to defeat the government. that s going to be the story i think of this coming general election.

1834,school sport is back says pm tony blair has promised that sport is back as a priority for schools. the prime minister launched a £ initiative to allow school sports clubs in england to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by . it s an important part of education and it s an important part of health mr blair said. but the conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours pe within school for % of pupils by - are unrealistic. the latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport with activities such as yoga and tai chi being options. launching the initiative mr blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl waverley sports college in southwark south london. he said: you ve got to bring back school sport. it s got to be done differently than it was or years ago. it s still very very important. earlier education secretary charles clarke told bbc news there were at least three areas which needed a coherent framework and dedicated funding . these were training for pe teachers establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as inter-school competitions. he added the government had originally pledged for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education a week. the proportion was currently at % and the government was hoping this would rise to % by and % by . the money for the initiative will come from a new £ fund. the £ move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from to . but the conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. shadow spokesman for sport hugh robertson said: i suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer. he said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports saying that an anti-competitive sport agenda had been pursued in recent years. martin ward of the secondary heads association said members did not like ring-fenced funds and that it should be up to the schools themselves to decide how to spend their money.

1854,hitachi unveils fastest robot japanese electronics firm hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot called emiew to challenge honda s asimo and sony s qrio robots. hitachi said the . (.) emiew was the world s quickest-moving robot yet. two wheel-based emiews pal and chum introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in japan. the robots will be guests at the world expo later this month. sony and honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics. explaining why hitachi s emiew used wheels instead of feet toshihiko horiuchi from hitachi s mechanical engineering research laboratory said: we aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people. we want to make the robots useful for people ... if the robots moved slower than people users would be frustrated. emiew - excellent mobility and interactive existence as workmate - can move at ./h. its wheel feet resemble the bottom half of a segway scooter. with sensors on the head waist and near the wheels pal and chum demonstrated how they could react to commands. i want to be able to walk about in places like shinjuku and shibuya [shopping districts] in the future without bumping into people and cars pal told reporters. hitachi said pal and chum which have a vocabulary of about words could be trained for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years. robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human. at the recent aaas (american association for the advancement of science) annual meeting in washington dc researchers showed off bipedal designs. the three designs each built by a different research group use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait. sony and honda have both used humanoid robots which are not commercially available as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. honda s asimo was born five years ago. since then honda and sony s qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events. asimo has visited the uk germany the czech republic france and ireland as part of a world tour. sony s qrio has been singing jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was until last year the fastest robot on two legs. but its record was beaten by asimo. it is capable of /h which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as qrio. last year car maker toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot. by it is predicted that there will be almost . million entertainment and leisure robots in homes compared to about currently according to the united nations (un). by the end of that year . million robots will be doing jobs in homes said the report by the un economic commission for europe and the international federation of robotics. hitachi is one of the companies with home cleaning robot machines on the market.
575,movie body hits peer-to-peer nets the movie industry has struck out at file-sharing networks with another round of lawsuits in the us. the motion picture association of america (mpaa) also said it had succeeded in getting a network called lokitorrent closed down. it is the latest network which uses the peer-to-peer system called bittorrent to be hit by the mpaa. the mpaa began its legal campaign against operators of similar networks across four continents in december. a dallas court agreed that hollywood lawyers would be allowed access to lokitorrent s server records which could let them single out those who were sharing files illegally. in october the site had provided links to more than files. the action came after the operators of lokitorrent agreed a settlement with the mpaa. a stark message has appeared on the site from the mpaa warning you can click but you can t hide . in bittorrent systems server sites do not host the files being shared. they host links called trackers that direct people to others that have it instead. as well as filing an unspecified number of file suits across the us the mpaa said it had given operators that host edonkey servers take down notices. hollywood studios are aggressively clamping down on file-sharers who it says infringe copyright laws by copying films and tv programmes then share the files online. but it is now targeting the operators of bittorrent networks themselves. it has filed lawsuits against operators of bittorrent server sites since december. the strategy of hitting those who run the servers which link to copyrighted material is intended to stunt file-sharers ability to swap content using bittorrent systems. the film industry says the black market for illegally copied videos and dvds already costs them billions every year and it is worried that illegal file-sharing is adding to their losses. in december the legal action claimed its most high-profile victim. the popular suprnova.org website was forced to close and others like phoenix torrent followed soon after.

1044,domain system scam fear a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers a trade body has warned. the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet electronic task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language. registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers says stephen dyer director of ukif. domain names are the real language addresses of websites rather than their internet protocol address which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so for example website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian a look just like an english a . but the computer code would be different and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent mr dyer said. although the idn problem is well known in technical circles the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked said mr dyer. it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site he added. there are solutions. for instance browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world s browsers. another solution to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water he said. centr the council of european national top level domain registries agrees. a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world the organisation said in a statement.
1818,warnings on woeful wi-fi security companies are getting worse at keeping their wireless data networks secure. a survey of wi-fi networks in london frankfurt new york and san francisco by rsa security found more than a third had basic security features turned off. by contrast last year s survey found that % of firms had failed to take basic steps to improve security. rsa warned that wi-fi s growing popularity made it much more likely that insecure networks would be found and exploited. wireless or wi-fi networks have become hugely popular over the last few years in offices because they are easy to set up and make going online much more convenient. this popularity shows no sign of slowing reveals the annual rsa security and netsurity survey which found an annual % growth rate in the number of wireless nets being installed in london and frankfurt. although most firms do take steps to turn on the security functions built in to the wi-fi standard and protect themselves from attack the survey found that a significant proportion were taking unnecessary risks. on average % of the wireless networks found by rsa and netsurity researchers in london frankfurt new york and san francisco had not used basic security systems. many firms were simply turning on their wireless net access points and use default settings that anyone familiar with wi-fi could easily find out. rsa said that % of wi-fi networks found london used default settings compared to % in frankfurt % in new york and % in san francisco. many users of wi-fi nets did not even turn on the encryption that scrambles data traffic between users and the access point helping them go online. this is despite a series of stories warning firms about the dangers of drive-by hacking in which computer criminals walk or drive around city centres using easy to use tools to spot wi-fi nets. these figures are another stark warning to unsecured businesses to get their act together said phil cracknell chief technology officer at netsurity. as more public wi-fi hotspots appear and people become more familiar with using them it was getting more likely that insecure would be found warned mr cracknell. accidental or intentional connection to a corporate network can bring with it a series of security issues including loss of confidential data and installation of malicious code he said.

2150,spain coach faces racism inquiry spain s football federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach luis aragones over racist comments about thierry henry. if found guilty aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about £ . the federation had initially declined to take action against aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in october. but its president angel maria villar changed his mind after a request by spain s anti-violence commission. aragones insisted the comments made to henry s arsenal club-mate jose antonio reyes were meant to motivate the player and were not intended to be offensive. i never intended to offend anyone and for that reason i have a very easy conscience he said at the time. i m obliged to motivate my players to get the best results. as part of that job i use colloquial language with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world. england s players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against spain in madrid last month. but the storm increased following racist chanting by spanish fans at england s black players during the game which spain won -. spain s minister of sport jaime lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the federation s decision. everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations and make sure they do not give a negative image he said. we are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism.
674,the pirates with no profit motive two men who were part of a huge network of internet software pirates known as drink or die have been convicted at the old bailey. bbc news investigates how the network worked and what motivated those involved. they called themselves drink or die (dod). they were a network of computer buffs who derived pleasure from cracking codes protecting copyrighted software such as windows . they would then share it with each other. there is no suggestion any of them profited financially. but the authorities in both britain and the united states considered it software piracy and took a dim view of networks such as dod one of a number of so-called warez organisations operating on the internet. in october the us customs service began an investigation into dod and other networks such as razor risciso myth and popz. fourteen months later us customs co-ordinated a series of raids across the globe as part of operation buccaneer. seventy search warrants were executed in the us britain australia norway sweden and finland. at least people were arrested worldwide - of them in the us. among the leaders of the network were americans john sankus - known by his internet nickname eriflleh (hellfire spelt backwards) - richard berry kent kartadinata and christopher tresco who used a server based at the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology (mit). the longest jail sentence - months - was handed down to sankus a -year-old from philadelphia. us attorney paul mcnulty said at the time: john sankus and his techno-gang operated in the faceless world of the internet and thought they would never be caught. they were wrong. these sentences and those to follow should send a message to others entertaining similar beliefs of invincibility. but one man still in legal limbo is british-born australian hew raymond griffiths who is still fighting against extradition to the us. us customs claimed mr griffiths was one of dod s leaders but his lawyer antony townsden told the bbc news website it was a laughable suggestion and added: he was living on welfare and had such an old computer that he couldn t even download software. the allegation that he was the group s co-leader is illusory. he had the least technical skills of anyone he couldn t crack any codes and he has only been called a leader because he was a loudmouth who wrote a lot on their messageboard. mr townsden said if he had committed any crimes he should be prosecuted in australia not the us. he claimed the australian government s decision to accept the extradition request was typical of their current acquiescent attitude to the us. mr griffiths is expecting to hear this week the outcome of his appeal against the decision to extradite him. those involved would give themselves internet aliases which would act in the same way as tags used by graffiti artists. they could then brag about their code-cracking abilities without giving away their real identities. alex bell whose trial at the old bailey ended on friday was known as mr - after a computer device - while his co-defendant steven dowd s nickname curiously was tim. a spokesman for us immigration customs and enforcement dean boyd said dod did not appear to be motivated by money. their motivation was the kudos which surrounded being able to crack sophisticated software. he told the bbc news website: primarily they were just interested in how fast they could crack the code. it was all about underground notoriety. but mr boyd pointed out that once the software had been distributed on the internet it fell into the hands of organised criminals who were able to mass produce pirated software at zero cost. it cost us industries a lot of money billions of dollars he said. mr boyd said: it was truly global in scope. we raided a number of universities including duke (in north carolina) and mit and found that several of the people involved were employed by major computer corporations. they would go home from work in the evenings and get involved in this warez culture. warez groups which began to surface in the early operate according to a strict code of honour. for example if one group cracked the software first its rivals would respect that achievement and not seek to claim it themselves. mr boyd said the destruction of dod was a great coup but he added: i m not going to sit here and say we have sorted the problem. there are still hackers and people who do this for fun. internet piracy of computer software remains a gigantic problem. a spokesman for the business software alliance said: dod members claim they did not profit at all. but they did profit by getting access to very expensive servers. he said dod and other warez groups were fostering a culture of piracy on the internet. he said % of computer software in britain was believed to have been pirated and this cost £ in revenue for software companies their suppliers and distributors. it may seem like a victimless crime but it touches more people than you might care to believe.

1314,ea to take on film and tv giants video game giant electronic arts (ea) says it wants to become the biggest entertainment firm in the world. the us firm says it wants to compete with companies such as disney and will only achieve this by making games appeal to mainstream audiences. ea publishes blockbuster titles such as fifa and john madden as well as video game versions of movies such as harry potter and the james bond films. its revenues were $ (£.) in which ea hoped to double by . ea is the biggest games publisher in the world and in had titles which sold in excess of one million copies each. nine of the biggest-selling games in the uk last year were published by ea. gerhard florin ea s managing director for european publishing said: doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science. he said it would take many years before ea could challenge disney - which in reported revenues of $ (£) - but it remained a goal for the company. we will be able to bring more people into gaming because games will be more emotional. mr florin predicted that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create real emotion. it s the subtleties the eyes the mouth - polygons doesn t really sell the emotion. with and xbox we can go on the main character with to polygons he said. with that increased firepower the finding nemo video game looks just like the movie but it will be interactive. mr florin said that more than % of all ea s games were sold to adults and played by adults but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children. our goal is to bring games to the masses which bring out emotions. ea said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry. nobody queues for music anymore. you can t ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it he said referring to demand for titles for such as grand theft auto: san andreas and halo . jan bolz ea s vice president of sales and marketing in europe said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. he said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality tv show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game the sims. one idea could be that you re controlling a family telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world playing the show said mr bolz. he also said ea was planning an international awards show similar to the oscars and the grammys which would combine video games music and movies. mr bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities. people will want to play video games if their heroes like robbie williams or christina aguilera are in them. mr florin said the challenge was to keep people playing in their and . there s an indication that a year old comes home from work and still wants to play games. if that s true that s a big challenge for tv broadcasters - because watching tv is the biggest pastime at present.
1658,labour pig poster anti-semitic the labour party has been accused of anti-semitism over a poster depicting michael howard and oliver letwin - who are both jewish - as flying pigs. prospective tory candidate andrew mennear whose finchley constituency contains a large jewish community branded it tasteless and offensive. the poster shows the two men s faces superimposed on winged pigs and says the day the tory sums add up . labour said the poster was not anti-jewish but anti-tory . it is one of four designs e-mailed to labour members who were asked to vote for their favourite. mr mennear who was sent the e-mail by a friend said he had been shocked by the image and had shown it to friends who were similarly horrified. he said there was nothing more distasteful for a jewish person than to be associated with a pig. i am not suggesting there is any deliberate intent but these sort of things can cause great offence. it clearly wasn t thought through. it is possible the posters were designed for maximum impact but this one clearly overstepped the mark and should be withdrawn. the campaign was particularly insensitive as it had come out at the same time as holocaust day a difficult time for many jewish people mr mennear added. a labour spokesman denied the campaign was anti-semitic. as we said at the time the james report (the tory backed inquiry into possible public spending savings) was published pigs will fly before the tory s sums will add up. this poster is making a serious point he said. a conservative party spokesman said: while the conservatives are concentrating on the issues that matter to people such as lower taxes and controlled immigration it is clear to see that the labour party is not. people will not be fooled.

2003,mild winter drives us oil down % us oil prices have fallen by % driven down by forecasts of a mild winter in the densely populated northeast. light crude oil futures fell $. to $. a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange (nymex) and have now lost $ in five days. nonetheless us crude is still % more expensive than at the beginning of boosted by growing demand and bottlenecks at refineries. traders ignored the possible effects of asia s tidal waves on global supplies. instead the focus is now on us consumption which is heavily influenced in the short term by the weather. with the revised milder temperatures... i m more inclined to think we ll push lower and test the $-. range said john brady of abn amro. the market definitely feels to be on the defensive. statistics released last week showed that stockpiles of oil products in the us had risen an indication that severe supply disruptions may not arise this winter barring any serious incident. oil prices have broken records in topping $ a barrel at one point driven up by a welter of worries about unrest in iraq and saudi arabia rising demand and supply bottlenecks. london s international petroleum exchange remained closed for the christmas holiday.
1427,gamers could drive high-definition tv films and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens. it is called high-definition - hd for short - and it is already hugely popular in japan and the us. it is set according to analysts to do for images what cds did for sound. different equipment able to receive hd signals is needed though and is expensive. but europe s gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand. europeans will have to wait until at least until they see mainstream hdtv. to view it it needs to be transmitted in hd format and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution. the next generation of consoles however are expected to start appearing at the end of start of . and most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures. in the next generation [of consoles] hd support is mandatory dr mark tuffy games systems director at digital content firm thx told the bbc news website. every game is going to be playable in hd. so consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on hdtvs and who have no content to watch are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures. it s going to change really the way they look at gaming. at the end of last year chris deering sony s european president made a prediction that million european households would have hdtv sets by . a previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at . million by an increase from an estimated sets at the end of . but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £ - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in and the bbc intends to produce all of its content in hd by . until broadcast rights format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed tv content will be limited. all tv images are made up of pixels which go across the screen and scan lines which go down the screen. most standard uk tv pictures are made up of lines and about pixels. hd offers up to active lines with each line made up of pixels. this means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard tv. probably in the uk [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off as in look what this tv can do until hd is really adopted by broadcasters explains dr tuffy. but gamers are also the ideal target audience for hd because they always crave better quality graphics and more immersive gaming experiences. they are used to spending money on hardware to match a game s requirements. demographics have changed too and the sweet spot for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late . this means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen high-definition display technologies and hd projectors earlier than others. higher capacity storage discs such as hd-dvd and blue-ray are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics. for console developers though hd offers some production changes. it could make games production slightly more expensive thinks dr tuffy. but we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a pc game and apply it to a console he says. you are literally going to get to the point with a lord of the rings game for example is going to be closer and closer to the actual film especially the cgi stuff from the dvd. and the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game just now they have almost got it seamless. with hd he says the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release. this could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. but it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide. at that point says dr tuffy games could become more or less interactive movies.
1407,split-caps pay £ compensation investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £ compensation the uk s financial watchdog has announced. eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the financial services authority (fsa). splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. but when the stock market collapsed in the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. an estimated people took out split-capital funds some investing their life savings in the schemes. the paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company the fsa said. further details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. this should save investors from having to take their case to the financial ombudsman service something no doubt that will be very welcome rob mcivor fsa spokesman told bbc news. agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt the fsa added. any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the financial ombudsman service. the fsa has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. the fsa s strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called magic circle in the hope of propping up one another s share prices. firms involved were presented with files of evidence detailing taped conversations and over interviews. in may the fsa was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £ in compensation. mr mcivor told the bbc that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the financial ombudsman service or the courts.
1458,what the election should really be about a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring poll. we ve called for the state pension to be increased from £. to the pensioner credit guarantee level of £.. that s what we re calling for. many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system. if we ve got one in five pensioners below the poverty line we ve got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty. we ve drawn up a pensioners manifesto. this will be sent to each of the candidates in the constituencies. they will be asked which of the top five issues including the pension issue they would support. once we ve got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well. it s our way of putting the politicians on notice. we are trying to get across the fact that there are voters over in the country they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters. before most pensioners voted conservative. in and they voted labour. but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around. they cannot take that vote for granted. pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner s full report into the issue. he said the uk had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world. that the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment. we haven t worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps. various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing. we don t have any large demonstrations planned but they can t be ruled out. it is hard to say whether we will be successful. we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq. repealing the hunting bill. we are challenging the use of the parliament act in a high court action. we are hoping to hear in the new year. whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. when the ban comes into force on february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid. so there s a lot of legal territory to go. we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking. whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (rural affairs minister) alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult. it is not intimidatory - on the whole it is groups of angry housewives. of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything. it will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face. it s exactly what the prime minister did not want. he wanted the issue off the table until after the election. people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad. the reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting. it is another sort of form of shooting for sport. the principle is the same whether it s a tiger or a pheasant. we will widely publicise what s happening in relation to trophy hunting. we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk. we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would-be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports. we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors. with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it. i think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure. but it will mobilise public opinion. everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban. the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice. the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum. choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade. it s become an issue in itself but what s really missing from the debate is the consumer s choice in that. choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools. we have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there s a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that. we want choice on the consumer s terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice. firstly we have our website. it features our campaigns and changes every day. secondly through our members who communicate with us. thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. we will invite the opinion formers mps journalists and others. the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians. i think we will be successful. it s very much the language being used by the main political parties. politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue. fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers. we have been hearing about this proposed increase of . per litre that gordon brown has been postponing and postponing. tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that s an increase of about £. if you re running vehicles it s obviously times that. if fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified. there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations. what it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business. we will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press. regrettably it s one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press. whatever we do the public don t like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority. but they don t realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work when you see a lorry it s already at work.
1882,indian oil firm eyes yukos assets india s biggest oil exploration firm oil & natural gas corp (ongc) says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled russian crude producer yukos. we are in touch with the concerned russian entities about the yukos assets and other opportunities in russia said ongc chairman subir raha. local press had reported that ongc was looking to buy % of yukos former key oil production unit for $ (£). yukos is being broken up by russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill. it was forced to sell its key production unit yuganskneftegas (yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $ in unpaid taxes and fines. state-owned rosneft now owns yugansk and russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. indian oil minister mani shankar aiyar discussed ongc s plans during a trip to moscow last year and the topic came up again during russian president vladimir putin s recent visit to new delhi. it would make great sense for us to build on that said mr aiyar. india s oil production has stagnated over recent years and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. india imports about % of its total oil consumption. at the same time india s economy is booming and the country s thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide. india produces about barrels of oil per day (bpd) little changed since the start of the according to oil industry analysts douglas-westwood. consumption meanwhile has jumped to . million bpd compared with bpd in . for countries to develop they have to have access to energy said john westwood managing director of oil industry analysts douglas-westwood. india is a dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil . by buying into yugansk ongc would be able to reduce its dependence on gulf states for oil imports mr westwood explained especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within india are slim. we forecast that indian production will go into significant decline mr westwood said. by production may only be at half of today s levels. ongc which is majority-owned by the indian state already has bought petroleum assets in countries including vietnam sudan and russia. the company is a partner with rosneft in the sakhalin- oil field off russia s siberian coast. ongc is however not the only firm interested in yugansk. chinese crude company china national petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor while on thursday italy refused to rule out an interest. ongc s interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world s biggest oil producers brought to its knees. the dispute is partly driven by president putin s clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. yukos has been battling the russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us. analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without yugansk. on thursday a us court said it will hear arguments for yukos bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on february. should that happen yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets analysts said.
154,google s toolbar sparks concern search engine firm google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites. the autolink feature comes with google s latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to amazon.com if it finds a book s isbn number on the site. it also links to google s map service if there is an address or to car firm carfax if there is a licence plate. google said the feature available only in the us adds useful links . but some users are concerned that google s dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like amazon. autolink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage - even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission. if a user clicks the autolink feature in the google toolbar then a webpage with a book s unique isbn number would link directly to amazon s website. it could mean online libraries that list isbn book numbers find they are directing users to amazon.com whether they like it or not. websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services. dan gillmor founder of grassroots media which supports citizen-based media said the tool was a bad idea and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth . in a statement google said the feature was still only in beta ie trial stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users. it said: the user can choose never to click on the autolink button and web pages she views will never be modified. in addition the user can choose to disable the autolink feature entirely at any time. the new tool has been compared to the smart tags feature from microsoft by some users. it was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised. smart tags allowed microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company. google said none of the companies which received autolinks had paid for the service. some users said autolink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any click through to a commercial site. cory doctorow european outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group electronic fronter foundation said that google should not be penalised for its market dominance. of course google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses. but as an end user i would want to know - can i choose to use this service how much is google being paid can i substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by google . mr doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using autolink or tricked into using the service .
999,buffy creator joins wonder woman the creator of buffy the vampire slayer is to take on a new female superhero after signing up to write and direct the wonder woman movie. joss whedon described the dc comics character as the most iconic female heroine of our time . in a way no one has met her yet he said. what i love most about icons is finding out what s behind them exploring the price of their power. linda carter played the character in the tv series. the character of wonder woman famed for her red and gold costume was born on paradise island and was blessed with the powers of strength and flight. the film is being produced by joel silver producer of the matrix trilogy. there s no one better than joss to adapt the legendary wonder woman comic book character created in the into a dynamic feature film for century audiences said silver. wonder woman was the first great female superhero to emerge from comic books and later inspire millions of fans in her television incarnation... but this groundbreaking heroine has yet to be reinvented for the feature film arena. whedon created the character of buffy in the screenplay for the film. he distanced himself from the movie because of the direction it eventually took and the film bombed. but he did not give up on the slayer and went on to write and executive produce seven seasons of the cult tv series. he also produced the spin-off angel series. he is currently directing the film serenity based on his short-lived sci-fi series firefly.

153,german business confidence slides german business confidence fell in february knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in europe s largest economy. munich-based research institute ifo said that its confidence index fell to . in february from . in january its first decline in three months. the study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up. we re surprised that the ifo index has taken such a knock said dz bank economist bernd weidensteiner. the main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak particularly in the retail trade. economy and labour minister wolfgang clement called the dip in february s ifo confidence figure a very mild decline . he said that despite the retreat the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected a modest economic upswing to continue. germany s economy grew .% last year after shrinking in . however the economy contracted by .% during the last three months of mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and ifo president hans-werner sinn said any improvement in german domestic demand was sluggish. exports had kept things going during the first half of but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making german products less competitive overseas. on top of that the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to % and manufacturing firms including daimlerchrysler siemens and volkswagen have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. analysts said that the ifo figures and germany s continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the european central bank. eurozone interest rates are at % but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation prompting fears that interest rates may rise.
1951,christmas sales worst since uk retail sales fell in december failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst christmas since . retail sales dropped by % on the month in december after a .% rise in november the office for national statistics (ons) said. the ons revised the annual rate of growth down from the .% estimated in november to .%. a number of retailers have already reported poor figures for december. clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth according to the ons. the last time retailers endured a tougher christmas was years previously when sales plunged .%. the ons echoed an earlier caution from bank of england governor mervyn king not to read too much into the poor december figures. some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figures showed a performance comparable with . the november-december jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages although some way below the serious booms seen in the . and figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending an indication that consumers are looking for bargains and retailers are cutting their prices. however reports from some high street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector. morrisons woolworths house of fraser marks & spencer and big food all said that the festive period was disappointing. and a british retail consortium survey found that christmas was the worst for years. yet other retailers - including hmv monsoon jessops body shop and tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year. investec chief economist philip shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates. the retail sales figures are very weak but as bank of england governor mervyn king indicated last night you don t really get an accurate impression of christmas trading until about easter said mr shaw. our view is the bank of england will keep its powder dry and wait to see the big picture.
945,guantanamo four questioned the four britons freed from us custody in guantanamo bay are expected to be allowed a visit by one relative. moazzam begg martin mubanga feroz abbasi and richard belmar were held for three years accused of al-qaeda links. mr begg s father azmat said he had been told he could see his son for minutes and would say he was a hero . the men are being held at london s paddington green police station where they are expected to be questioned by uk anti-terror officers. but louise christian the lawyer representing mr abbasi and mr mubanga said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station. before being driven by police from birmingham to london azmat begg said he was concerned for his son moazzam s mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug. as azmat begg arrived at the london police station there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements. police have said they have a duty to investigate the men who were arrested on their return to the uk. but metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens said evidence obtained by while the four were in cuba was absolutely inadmissible in uk courts. in an interview with the independent sir john said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the uk. he told the newspaper: if an admission is made it is a totally different ball game... it could be used as evidence. the options are: if there is enough evidence they will be charged. if not they will be released as soon as possible. the men have been allowed to meet their lawyers. louise christian said that after being tortured and abused at guantanamo bay the men s arrest was unfair and inappropriate. she told bbc news she remained very concerned about their psychological state. gareth peirce lawyer for mr begg said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them. washington has claimed all four were enemy combatants who trained at camps run by al-qaeda. the pentagon says they were freed after the uk government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the us or any of its allies. the detainees were immediately arrested under section of the terrorism act when they landed at raf northolt west london on tuesday. massoud shadjareh from the muslim safety forum said: what sort of homecoming is this they are innocent people. the muslim council of britain urged that the men should receive counselling and medical help. we want these men to be returned into the arms of their waiting family said iqbal sacranie secretary general of the council.
882,web logs aid disaster recovery some of the most vivid descriptions of the devastation in southern asia are on the internet - in the form of web logs or blogs. bloggers have been offering snapshots of information from around the region and are also providing some useful information for those who want to help. indian writer rohit gupta edits a group blog called dogs without borders. when he created it the site was supposed to be a forum to discuss relations between india and pakistan. but in the wake of sunday s tsunami mr gupta and his fellow bloggers switched gears. they wanted to blog the tsunami and its aftermath. one sri lankan blogger in the group goes by the online name morquendi. with internet service disrupted by the tsunami morquendi started sending sms text messages via cell phone from the affected areas of sri lanka. we started publishing these smses says mr gupta. morquendi was describing scenes like bodies washed up on a shore and people burying and burying and burying them. people digging holes with their hands. and this was coming through an sms message. we didn t have visual accounts on radio or on tv or in the print media. soon thousands of web users around the world were logging on to read morquendi s first hand accounts. in one message morquendi wrote about a sri lankan woman who was running home with a friend when the wave hit. she was being swept away morquendi s message read. she grabbed a tree with one hand and her friend with the other. she says she watched the water pull her friend away. mr gupta says the power of morquendi s text message blogs was palpable. he was running around looking for friends burying bodies carrying bodies mr gupta says of morquendi. i can t even begin to imagine the psychological state he was in when he was sending us reports and doing the relief work at the same time. he was caught between being a journalist and being a human being. others blogs are helping to spread information about relief efforts. dina mehta is an indian blogger who s helping with the newly created south east asia earthquake and tsunami blog. she says the blog is not meant to be filled with first person accounts. what we re doing is we re building a resource she says. anyone who says ok i want to come and do some work in india volunteer in india or in sri lanka or malaysia this is the sort of one-stop-shop that they can come to for all sorts of resources - emergency help lines relief agencies aid agencies contacts for them etc. ms mehta also says she wishes that governments in the region would realise the power of blogs. imagine if they had this resource available to them if there was a disaster how quickly you could funnel aid in and get people to help she says. bloggers in the united states are also getting involved. ramdhan yadav kotamaraja is originally from india but now lives in dallas. mr kotamaraja wanted to help those affected by the tsunami by pooling money with concerned friends. so he set up an online payment system on his website. then says mr kotamaraja the blogging world found out. all my blogger friends started linking up my site and i saw a lot of people other than my friends. i d say % of the donations came from people i don t know. it s simply unbelievable to me that people that i don t know will come and start donating. news spreads quickly on weblogs a phenomenon that helps bloggers expand their audience and scope. in sri lanka blogger morquendi is recruiting others to help. one recruit calls himself heretic. in one of his latest posts heretic asks: have you ever seen fishing trawlers on the road ever seen a bus inside a house well heretic writes that was just the least affected areas - so you can just imagine - or can you he concludes: keep it blogged. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.
1003,microsoft releases bumper patches microsoft has warned pc users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in windows programs. in its monthly security bulletin it flagged up eight critical security holes which could leave pcs open to attack if left unpatched. the number of holes considered critical is more than usual. they affect windows programs including internet explorer (ie) media player and instant messaging. four other important fixes were also released. these were considered to be less critical however. if not updated either automatically or manually pc users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely install programs change and delete or see data. one of the critical patches microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some ie flaws. stephen toulouse a microsoft security manager said the flaws were known about and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw he did not rule them out. often when a critical flaw is announced spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. a further patch fixes a hole in media player windows messenger and msn messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. the most important ones are those which are classed as critical . its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker sybari software as part of microsoft s plans to make its own security programs.
1325,ask jeeves joins web log market ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs. the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read search and share all the blogs they are interested in. ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed. bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication (rss) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. google acquired pyra labs makers of the blogger software in . in msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. jim lanzone vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it. the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers he said. mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask s my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites he said. it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates. there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines said mr lanzone. our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away he said. though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right said mr lanzone. rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders.

1088,germany calls for eu reform german chancellor gerhard schroeder has called for radical reform of the eu s stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits. mr schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current % limit if they met certain criteria. writing in the financial times mr schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms. changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in march. the current eu rules limit the size of a eurozone country s deficit to % of gdp. countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the european commission although several countries including germany have breached the rules consistently since without facing punishment. the european commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules. mr schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions. the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions he wrote. only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu. deficits should be allowed to rise above % mr schroeder argued if countries meet several mandatory criteria . these include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering special economic burdens . the proposed changes would make it harder for the european commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact s rules. mr schroeder s intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the eurozone finance ministers on monday to discuss the pact. the issue will also be discussed at tuesday s ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all eu members. mr schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact. a number of eu finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone s rules.
519,no to royal succession shake-up a labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the royal family the same rights as males. the legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the crown. it would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics. but the government refused to back lord dubs succession to the crown bill saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues. the lord chancellor lord falconer agreed the act of settlement which governs the succession was discriminatory but added that for all practical purposes its effects are limited . the changes proposed by lord dubs were a complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues he said. lord falconer said there were members of the royal family in the line of succession after the prince of wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act. it is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. while we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn t the proper form he added. he did not rule out change in the future but said if lord dubs private member s bill was passed by peers he would urge mps to oppose it in the commons. lord dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the house of lords but urged the government to think again at a later stage. we cannot forever say we don t want to change things because it is too difficult he told peers. during the debate the labour peer and former minister said: the monarchy should symbolise the values of this country. what we don t want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times. we are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against catholics. but opponents of the bill including tory lord campbell of alloway and the bishop of winchester the rt rev michael scott-joynt said it would separate the state from both the church of england and the christian faith. such a secular state would be markedly less tolerant rt rev scott-joynt argued.
505,gallas sees two-horse race chelsea s william gallas believes they will battle it out with arsenal for the premiership in the coming months. it ll be a two-horse race all the way to the end of the season because we are both going to give it everything he told bbc sport. you need to be good and you need a lot of luck. you need a bit of both but it will be as hard for the arsenal players as it is for the chelsea boys. we know that we have got the power in our hands just now added gallas. but you never know what is going to happen in football - two seasons ago manchester united picked up so many points towards the end of the season when they won the title. obviously nobody at chelsea wants to come second but you never know what happens in football. we will be challenging to come first as much as every arsenal player will be challenging to come first. gallas has been given extra confidence by the impact manager jose mourinho has had since taking over as manager during the summer. and the french international defender believes mourinho is perfectly suited to boss the squad of chelsea stars and says his managerial expertise will prevent any player revolt. it s only normal when you have got a team put together of such big names that you put the finishing touch to it and the finishing touch at chelsea is a fantastic manager like mourinho he said. he is the icing on the cake at the club. he has this fantastic knack of thinking of everything. another incredible quality that mourinho has is that every player even though the fans may consider them to be a stars within the dressing-room they are absolutely equal. mourinho reminds everyone but he doesn t have to because he has created a wonderful atmosphere where everybody is playing and laughing every day. it is a changed dressing-room from the atmosphere there was last year.
1279,wales want rugby league training wales could follow england s lead by training with a rugby league club. england have already had a three-day session with leeds rhinos and wales are thought to be interested in a similar clinic with rivals st helens. saints coach ian millward has given his approval but if it does happen it is unlikely to be this season. saints have a week s training in portugal next week while wales will play england in the opening six nations match on february. we have had an approach from wales confirmed a saints spokesman. it s in the very early stages but it is something we are giving serious consideration to. st helens who are proud of their welsh connections are obvious partners for the welsh rugby union despite a spat in over the collapse of kieron cunningham s proposed £ move to union side swansea. a similar cross-code deal that took iestyn harris from leeds to cardiff in did go through before the talented stand-off returned to the -man code with bradford bulls. kel coslett who famously moved from wales to league in the is currently saints football manager while clive griffiths - wales defensive coach - is a former st helens player and is thought to be the man behind the latest initiative. scott gibbs the former wales and lions centre played for st helens from - and was in the challenge cup-winning team at wembley in .
1975,lifestyle governs mobile choice faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests. instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an in-depth study by handset maker ericsson. historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson s consumer and enterprise lab. we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said. we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website. for the study ericsson interviewed mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. people s habits remain the same said dr bjorn. they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it s a much more convenient way to do it. one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people he said. while diaries have always been popular a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. ericsson s research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways. dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago. this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch. another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. only when about % of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it. once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off. dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. however he said now % of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. in the figure was %. similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. in only % of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month. now the figure is %. similar rises have been seen in many other european nations. dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said. digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays. by contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.
1898,blair dismisses quit claim report tony blair has dismissed reports he told gordon brown he would quit before the next general election. you don t do deals over jobs like this the prime minister told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme. according to a new book brown s britain mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june . mr blair said the claims were reheated from six months ago and that he was concentrating on running the country. mr blair said: i ve dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don t do deals over jobs like this - you don t. what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country. the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston and serialised in the newspaper said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other. it claims tony blair felt by november he had lost voters trust because of the iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party. and that at a dinner hosted by deputy prime minister john prescott he told mr brown of his intention to stand down. according to mr peston the prime minister said: help me to get through the year and i will then stand down. but he then changed his mind in june following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him according to the book. mr peston told bbc news: my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. what the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust mutual animosity. i think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright but in private i don t think the relationship is good because brown understandably feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership. but in a wide-ranging bbc interview covering issues such as the asian tsunami disaster the middle east peace process and northern ireland mr blair said: when you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you. all sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims. he admitted to a sense of frustration about the allegations which he said had been made countless times . there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently following their separate responses to the asian tsunami. these rumours were fuelled by mr blair s decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new marshall plan for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster. but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a load of nonsense . former welfare minister frank field mp said the prime minister should sack mr brown but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so. tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of squabbling like schoolboys . he told sky news sunday with adam boulton: this is the politics of the playground and britain really does deserve better. the liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was getting in the way of good government . either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election. during the interview mr blair also said the former home secretary david blunkett would play a big role at the general election.

104,howard pitches for uk ethnic vote michael howard is to make a pitch for britain s ethnic vote urging people who feel taken for granted by tony blair to vote conservative. he will say conservatives share the same values as the uk s minorities. and that he wants to build a better britain where everyone whatever the colour of their skin or religion can make the most of their talents . but the tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is outdated and unjust . it sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities he will argue. mr howard - himself the son of immigrants - will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the uk. people from ethnic communities for example still earn less than their white counterparts he will say before arguing the answer to helping everyone to get on was free enterprise free trade free speech . the tory leader will also call for religious tolerance arguing that hindus and sikhs as well as muslims got caught in the downdraft of islamaphobia which was one of the terrible side effects of / . mr howard will make his speech during a visit to support tory parliamentary hopefuls robert light and sayeeda warsi - the first british muslim woman selected to run for mp as a conservative candidate. he will attack labour s record in government over issues such as tax and he will set out tory plans for an immigration quota to be set by mps. mr howard will also attack the lib dems for wanting to abolish faith schools introduce compulsory sex education from the age of seven and give contraceptives out in schools from the age of . so i say to all those people from ethnic minorities who feel mr blair and the liberal democrats take their votes for granted - come join us he will say. lib dem president simon hughes branded mr howard arrogant and wrong for claiming the tories were the natural party for britain s ethnic minorities. given the tories considerably reduced support in urban areas where many black and asian britons live during their time in power the evidence simply does not support his claims that the conservatives are the party for these communities he said.

978,february poll claim speculation reports that tony blair is planning a snap general election for february have been described as idle speculation by downing street. a spokesman said he had no idea where the reports in the sunday times and sunday telegraph had come from. the papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a baghdad bounce following successful iraq elections in january. a british general election was last held in february in . in that election edward heath lost and failed to build a coalition with the liberals. harold wilson took over and increased his majority later in the year in a second election the latest speculation suggests the prime minister favours a february poll in order to exploit his current opinion poll lead over conservative leader michael howard. but that strategy could prompt criticism he was seeking to cut and run after less then four years of a parliamentary term. the papers report that alan milburn labour s head of elections strategy has played a key role in the plan for a february election which would include a new year advertising blitz. new labour s campaign both newspapers said would be centred around the slogan britain is working . a labour party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for mr blair but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in february. most commentators have been expecting an election on may. the last election was in june .
621,ministers naive over phone-taps the government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court a senior eu politician says. javier solana eu foreign policy chief says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other european countries. human rights groups top police officers and many mps say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge. but home secretary charles clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases. mr solana told s jonathan dimbleby programme: [phone-tap evidence in court] works it is normal that it is done it would be naive not to do it. it would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal. mr solana s comments come the day after sir ian blair the newly-appointed metropolitan police commissioner said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence. under the anti-terrorism crimes and security act foreign terror suspects can be detained in british jails without trial or charge. several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court. some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. human rights group liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard these detainees could be brought to trial. but critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services. the home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance. but mr clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after law lords ruled it illegal. he has opted for a system of control orders whereby suspects both british and foreign can be held under house arrest or surveillance. these orders will again involve a uk opt-out of parts of the european convention on human rights. while accepting that people have to be prepared for a possible terrorist attack mr solana said he had qualms about the home secretary s new plans. we have to fight terrorism with all our means but not so far as to change our way of life he said.
2075,google to scan famous libraries the libraries of five of the world s most important academic institutions are to be digitised by google. scanned pages from books in the public domain will then be made available for search and reading online. the full libraries of michigan and stanford universities as well as archives at harvard oxford and the new york public library are included. online pages from scanned books will not have adverts but will have links to online store amazon google said. the goal of the project is to unlock the wealth of information that is offline and bring it online said susan wojcicki director of product management at google. there will also be links to public libraries so that the books can be borrowed. google will not be paid for providing for the links. it will take six years to digitise the full collection at michigan which contains seven million volumes. users will only have access to extracts and bibliographies of copyrighted works. the new york library is allowing google to include a small portion of books no longer covered by copyright. harvard is limiting its participation to books while oxford wants google to scan books originally published in the century and held in the bodleian library. a spokeswoman for oxford university said the digitised books would include novels poetry political tracts and art books. important works that are out of print or only available in a few libraries around the world will be made available to everyone she said. about one million books will be scanned by google less than % of the total collection held in the bodleian. we hope that oxford s contribution to this project will be of scholarly use as well as general interest to people around the world said reg carr director of oxford university library services. it s a significant opportunity to bring our material to the rest of the world said paul leclerc president of the new york public library. it could solve an old problem: if people can t get to us how can we get to them this is the day the world changes said john wilkin a university of michigan librarian working with google. it will be disruptive because some people will worry that this is the beginning of the end of libraries. but this is something we have to do to revitalise the profession and make it more meaningful.

1656,egypt and israel seal trade deal in a sign of a thaw in relations between egypt and israel the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the us allowing egyptian goods made in partnership with israeli firms free access to american markets. the protocol signed in cairo will establish what are called qualified industrial zones in egypt. products from these zones will enjoy duty free access to the us provided that % of their components are the product of israeli-egyptian cooperation. the us describes this as the most important economic agreement between egypt and israel in two decades. the protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years. there has been deep sensitivity in egypt about any form of co-operation with israel as long as its peace process with the palestinians remains blocked. but in recent weeks an unusual warmth has crept into relations between the two countries. both exchanged prisoners earlier this month with egypt handing back an israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying. egyptian president hosni mubarak has described israeli prime minister ariel sharon as the best chance for the palestinians to achieve peace. the government in cairo now believes mr sharon is moving towards the centre and away from the positions of right wing groups. it also believes the us pressed by europe is now more willing to engage seriously in the search for a settlement. but there are also pressing economic reasons for egypt s decision to enter into the trade agreement. it will give a huge boost to egyptian textile exports which are about to suffer a drop after new regulations come into force in the us at the beginning of the year.
1552,attack prompts bush site block the official re-election site of president george w bush is blocking visits from overseas users for security reasons . the blocking began early on monday so those outside the us and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it. but keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective. many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses. the policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.com website. scott stanzel a spokesman for the bush-cheney campaign said: the measure was taken for security reasons. he declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy. the barring of non-us visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place. in early october a so-called denial of service attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of pcs. the attack made the site unusable for about five hours. about the same time the web team of the bush-cheney campaign started using the services of a company called akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic. akamai uses a web-based tool called edgescape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based. typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic. geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. readers of the boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the george w bush domain name. ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site. there are now at least three working alternative domains for the bush-cheney campaign that let web users outside the us visit the site. the site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us. some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site. the international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. netcraft said that since the early hours of october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney have failed. by contrast netcraft s four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems. data gathered by netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack. mike prettejohn netcraft president speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run-up to the election on november. he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. however simply blocking non-us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too. most american soldiers stationed overseas will be able to see the site as they use the us military s own portion of the net. akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites.
109,web radio takes spanish rap global spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish-language music. but what you will not find is much spanish-language hip-hop. hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish-speaking world but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. but now a us company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico s hottest hip-hop acts. they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey. but most mexican hip-hop fans not to mention fans in most of the spanish-speaking world rarely get a chance to hear the group s tracks on the radio. you can t really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in spanish... it s just not accessible says manuel millan a native of san diego california. it s really hard for the spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world. millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally. mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. so millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. the name says it all: it is web-based radio devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. the site which is in both in english and spanish is meant to be easy to navigate. all the user has to do is download a media player. there are no djs. it is just music streamed over the net for free. suddenly with the help of the website los caballeros de plan g are producing export quality rap. the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now. the genre is in what millan calls its infant stage . but the production values are improving and artists such as argentina s mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better. mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. he s considered the eminem of argentina and the latin american hip-hop scene millan says. he really hasn t had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world but he s definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world. currently the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com s top as is cuban artist papo record. every country s got it s own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs millan says. latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world. right now mexico leads the way accounting for about % of listeners. but web surfers in spain are logging in as well - about % of the web station s traffic comes from there. that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish-language rap and hip-hop. millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. that might be changing though as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences. but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com s top . his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in spain. on his track uno contra veinte emcees or one against emcees tote king shows he is well aware of that fact. it s basically him bragging that he s one of the best emcees in spain right now millan says. and it s pretty much true. he has the tightest productions and his rap flow is impeccable it s amazing. latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip-hop and rap. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.

348,rapper cent ends protege feud rapper cent has ended his public feud with his protege the game as the pair said they wanted to be good role models for their communities. the row blew up when cent threw the game out of his g-unit crew and accused him of being disloyal. a member of the game s entourage was reportedly shot outside a radio station where cent was being interviewed. but the pair shook hands as they handed over money to music projects for new york s deprived areas on wednesday. the game whose real name is jayceon taylor told a news conference: i want to apologise. i m almost ashamed to have participated in the things that went on over the last few weeks. chart-topper cent real name curtis jackson said the truce came on the anniversary of the death of the notorious big in who was part of a volatile feud between the east and west coast rap scenes. we re here today to show that people can rise above the most difficult circumstances and together we can put negativity behind us cent said. a lot of people don t want to see it happen but we re responding to the two most important groups - our family and our fans. the boys choir of harlem got a cheque for $ (£ ) from cent while the game handed over $ (£ ). the game also made a contribution to the compton schools music programme. cent announced he has launched the g-unity foundation to help people overcome obstacles and make a chance for the better in their lives . i realised that if i m going to be effective at that i have to overcome some of my own he said. game and i need to set an example in the community. cent is no stranger to feuds with rapper ja rule among the targets for ridicule in his songs. on his latest album released earlier this month he turned his attentions to fat joe and nas who have both worked with ja rule. both he and the game have admitted drug dealing in the past and have both been shot.
1805,kelly trails new discipline power teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a zero tolerance drive education secretary ruth kelly has suggested. ms kelly told the bbc progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems. the minister also confirmed she received spiritual support from the catholic movement opus dei. but she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs. the conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the run-up to the next general election. ms kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight. she told bbc one s breakfast with frost: it is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom. we have made huge progress on the really difficult cases the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour. but quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled. i would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision. it is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes. head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school who sexually abuse pupils or other people who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour. ms kelly entered the cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then home secretary david blunkett. her links to opus dei which means work of god in latin have provoked controversy. critics say the organisation which adheres strictly to catholic teachings is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims. asked if she was a member of the group ms kelly said: i do have spiritual support from opus dei and that is right. but those are private spiritual matters and i m sure you ll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life. she categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister. her collective responsibility as a cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas she argued. the government has yet to issue its official response to the tomlinson review which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma. ms kelly said reforms should build on gcses and a-levels. her comments did not impress tory shadow education secretary tim collins. ruth kelly wants to ditch the tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place he said. she also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how. this is an all talk agenda that lets down children teachers and parents.
734,minister digs in over doping row the belgian sports minister at the centre of the svetlana kuznetsova doping row says he will not apologise for making allegations against her. claude eerdekens claims the us open champion tested positive for ephedrine at an exhibition event last month. criticised for making the announcement he said: i will never apologise. this product is banned and it s up to her to explain why it s there. kuznetsova says the stimulant may have been in a cold remedy she took. the russian said she did nothing wrong by taking the medicine during the event. the women s tennis association cleared kuznetsova of any offence because the drug is not banned when taken out of competition. eerdekens said he made the statement in order to protect the other three players that took part in the tournament belgian justine henin-hardenne nathalie dechy of france and russia s elena dementieva. but dechy is fuming that she has been implicated in the row. how can you be happy when you see your face on the cover page and talking about doping dechy said. i m really upset about it and i think the belgian government did a really bad job about this. i think we deserve an apology from the guy. you cannot say anything like this - you cannot say some stuff like this saying it s one of these girls. this is terrible. dementieva is also angry and says that dechy and herself are the real victims of the scandal. you have no idea what i have been through all these days. it s been too hard on me she said. the wta are trying to handle this problem by saying there are three victims but i see only two victims in this story - me and nathalie dechy who really have nothing to do with this. to be honest with you i don t feel like i want to talk to sveta at all. i m just very upset with the way everything has happened.

432,england - france england suffered an eighth defeat in tests as scrum-half dimitri yachvili booted france to victory at twickenham. two converted tries from olly barkley and josh lewsey helped the world champions to a - half-time lead. but charlie hodgson and barkley missed six penalties between them while yachvili landed six for france to put the visitors in front. england could have won the game with three minutes left but hodgson pushed an easy drop goal opportunity wide. it was a dismal defeat for england coming hard on the heels of an opening six nations loss in wales. they should have put the game well beyond france s reach but remarkably remained scoreless for the entire second half. a scrappy opening quarter saw both sides betray the lack of confidence engendered by poor opening displays against wales and scotland respectively. hodgson had an early opportunity to settle english nerves but pushed a straightforward penalty attempt wide. but a probing kick from france centre damien traille saw mark cueto penalised for holding on to the ball in the tackle yachvili giving france the lead with a kick from wide out. france twice turned over england ball at the breakdown early on as the home side struggled to generate forward momentum one ben kay charge apart. a spell of tit-for-tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides until england refused a possible three points to kick a penalty to the corner only to botch the subsequent line-out. but england made the breakthrough after minutes when a faltering move off the back of a scrum led to the opening try. jamie noon took a short pass from barkley and ran a good angle to plough through yann delaigue s flimsy tackle before sending his centre partner through to score at the posts. hodgson converted and added a penalty after one of several french infringements on the floor for a - lead. the fly-half failed to dispense punishment though with a scuffed attempt after france full-back pepito elhorga scragged by lewsey threw the ball into touch. barkley also missed two longer-range efforts as the first half drew to a close but by then england had scored a second converted try. after a series of phases lock danny grewcock ran hard at the french defence and off-loaded out of sylvain marconnet s tackle to lewsey. the industrious wing cut back in on an angle and handed off hooker sebastien bruno to sprint over. after a dire opening to the second half france threw on three forward replacements in an attempt to rectify the situation wing jimmy marlu having already departed injured. yachvili nibbled away at the lead with a third penalty after minutes. and when lewis moody was twice penalised - for handling in a ruck and then straying offside - the scrum-half s unerring left boot cut the deficit to two points. barkley then missed his third long-range effort to increase the tension. and after seeing another attempt drop just short yachvili put france ahead with his sixth penalty with minutes left. england sent on ben cohen and matt dawson and after barkley s kick saw christophe dominici take the ball over his own line the stage was set for a victory platform. but even after a poor scrummage hodgson had the chance to seal victory but pushed his drop-goal attempt wide. england threw everything at the french in the final frantic moments but the visitors held on for their first win at twickenham since . j robinson (capt); m cueto j noon o barkley j lewsey; c hodgson h ellis; g rowntree s thompson p vickery; d grewcock b kay; j worsley l moody m corry. a titterrell a sheridan s borthwick a hazell m dawson h paul b cohen. p elhorga; c dominici b liebenberg d traille j marlu; y delaigue d yachvili; s marconnet s bruno n mas; f pelous (capt) j thion s betsen j bonnaire s chabal. w servat j milloud g lamboley y nyanga p mignoni f michalak j-p grandclaude. paddy o brien (new zealand)

1837,watchdog probes e-mail deletions the information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of cabinet office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old. richard thomas totally condemned the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on january. government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served no current purpose mr thomas said. the tories and the lib dems have questioned the timing of the new rules. tory leader michael howard has written to tony blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. on monday lib dem constitutional affairs committee chairman alan beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the hutton inquiry. the timing of the new rules just before the freedom of information act comes into forces was too unlikely to have been a coincidence mr beith said. but a cabinet office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or the destruction of important records . mr beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the e-mail regime could support the freedom of information regime . mr thomas said: the new act of parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence. he said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. all e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws but the important thing was the content of the e-mail said mr thomas. if in doubt retain that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. it s only when you ve got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. but any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned. the freedom of information act will cover england wales and northern ireland from next year. similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about public bodies subject to various exemptions. its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.
930,apple attacked over sources row civil liberties group the electronic frontier foundation (eff) has joined a legal fight between three us online journalists and apple. apple wants the reporters to reveal sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products including the mac mini. the eff representing the reporters has asked california s superior court to stop apple pursuing the sources. it argues that the journalists are protected by the american constitution. the eff says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press. apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named asteroid and has asked the journalists e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that. rather than confronting the issue of reporter s privilege head-on apple is going to the journalist s isps for his e-mails said eff lawyer kurt opsahl. this undermines a fundamental first amendment right that protects all reporters. if the court lets apple get away with this and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news analysis and commentary he said. the case began in december when apple asked a local californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites appleinsider.com and powerpage.org. apple also sent requested information from the nfox.com the internet service provider of powerpage s publisher jason o-grady. as well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines. the eff has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with apple including professor tom goldstein former dean of the journalism school at the university of california and dan gillmor a well-known silicon valley journalist. apple was not immediately available for comment.

1629,wmc says xstrata bid is too low australian mining firm wmc resources has said it is worth up to % more than a hostile . australian dollar ($.; £) bid by rival xstrata. there is now pressure on swiss-based xstrata to increase its takeover offer. a report from investment firm grant samuel in wmc defence documents values wmc shares at a$. to a$. against xstrata s bid of a$. a share. analysts said the defence documents provided more details on wmc and may trigger a possible rival bid. if a bid is going to emerge it is probably likely in the next one to two weeks said daiwa securities analyst mark pervan. he said the valuation would put increased pressure on xstrata to look at sweetening its offer. marc gonsalves an executive at xstrata said: we will review the information contained in the target s statement over the next week or so. he added: while we will review the assumptions made by grant samuel in detail we are extremely sceptical of their conclusion and suggest that wmc shareholders take extreme care in presuming that these optimistic assumptions are capable of being realised. last month australia s competition watchdog said it would not oppose the purchase of wmc by zurich and london-based xstrata. on tuesday wmc chairman tommie bergman said in a statement the directors believed it was in shareholders best interest to reject the offer. he said wmc would pursue value-creating options provided by a portfolio of world class assets . and wmc chief executive andrew michelmore claimed the xstrata offer was aimed at creating value for xstrata s shareholders and was not being made for the benefit of wmc s shareholders. grant samuel said its valuation of wmc was based on lower average prices for nickel copper and uranium than current market levels. any longer term commodity price improvements would only improve our outlook mr michelmore said. in xstrata acquired australia s largest copper miner - mim holdings. wmc resources is the world s third-largest producer of concentrated nickel and also a miner of copper and uranium. it owns the olympic dam mine in south australia which contains about one-third of the world s known uranium resources and is also the world s fourth largest copper mine. xstrata is a global mining giant with operations in australia south africa spain germany argentina and the uk. its core products are copper coking coal thermal coal ferrochrome vanadium and zinc. it also has growing businesses in gold lead and silver.
2183,piero gives rugby perspective bbc sport unveils its new analysis tool piero at the wales v england rugby union match on saturday. but what does it do and how does it work picture the scene - wales are camped on the england line in the dying seconds of the six nations opening match. a ball is flung out to winger shane williams who crosses to score the winning try for wales. but the england players are incensed - arguing that the pass was forward and the try should not stand. in the past sports fans would be left debating the validity of the try for days and weeks to come. but bbc sport s new tool piero could end discussions in minutes. piero named after the italian painter and pioneer of perspective piero della francesco creates a virtual stadium in which virtual players can be tracked from almost any angle. viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts. the technology has been created by bbc research and development for bbc broadcast and bbc outside broadcasts. bbc sport is the first client to start using the system. in order to keep audiences growing and growing... we need to work closely with people who create technology and innovation to bring sport to life said andrew thompson the bbc s head of development new media and sports news. we want to appeal to core fans - to give them more analysis more detail more definitive answers about key passages of play. piero works by taking telemetric data from fixed camera positions and sending that data inside the video signal to a pc which can then render the information into graphics. the more cameras using piero the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into models. it allows us to tell the story of a passage of play tracking individual players across the field looking at tactics said andy townsend from bbc broadcast. an operator can manipulate the information and provide almost real-time replays of incidents as well as more in-depth analysis. the virtual camera can focus on virtually any aspect of the pitch giving viewers an insight into action that the camera normally cannot see. piero also provides a wealth of statistical detail - from the length of kicks to the length of a run of an individual player and the height of a lift at any lineout. mr townsend said sports performance companies were already showing an interest in the technology. bbc broadcast hopes the technology can be sold to third parties interested in using it a number of different ways - from sport broadcasting to entertainment and game shows.
1341,georgia plans hidden asset pardon georgia is offering a one-off tax amnesty to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president eduard shevardnadze. the country s new president mikhail saakashvili has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay % in income tax. the measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost georgia s flagging economy. georgia s black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy. mr saakashvili elected president in january after mr shevardnadze was toppled has urged the georgian parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. it is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption which was rampant during the shevardnadze era and boost georgia s fragile public finances. the new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before january three days before president saakashvili was elected. there are people who have money but are afraid to show it the president told a government session. documentation about where this money came from doesn t exist because under the former entirely warped regime earning capital honestly was not possible. by declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax people would be able to legalise their property mr saakashvili stressed. no one will have the right to check this money s origin. this money must go back into the economy. the amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about % of georgian businesses -are to continue. mr saakashvili has accused the shevardnadze regime which was toppled by a popular uprising in november of allowing bribery to flourish. georgia s economy is in a desperate condition. half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $ or three euros a day. the unemployment rate is around % while the country has a $. public debt.

996,benitez joy as reds take control liverpool boss rafael benitez was satisfied after his team s - win over bayer leverkusen despite conceding a goal in the last minute. before the game if you had said the score will be - i would have happily accepted that said benitez. but you must realise that you have to concentrate right to the very last seconds of a game at this level. i have confidence that we can complete the task in germany. i am always confident and we must be positive. benitez defended goalkeeper jerzy dudek whose failure to hold on to dimitar berbatov s weak drive allowed franca to score with the last kick of the game - and give the german team a lifeline for the second leg. for me it was not jerzy dudek s fault added benitez. he had played a very good game - and had we scored our other chances nobody would be talking about about their goal. it would not have mattered. if we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal. in my opinion jerzy played well made two very fine saves - and i am happy with him. if we lose - we are out but i think we can score in germany - certainly one and that will make all the difference. and the liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper steven gerrard who was suspended for the anfield leg back for the return in germany. steven gerrard is a key player for us said benitez. when he is on the pitch he makes everyone else play better - and the opposition pay special attention to him - which gives space for others. steven is one of the best players in the world but i need a team that is not about just one player. there must be players on the pitch all doing well.

1181,apple unveils low-cost mac mini apple has unveiled a new low-cost macintosh computer for the masses billed as the mac mini. chief executive steve jobs showed off the new machine at his annual macworld speech in san francisco. the $ macintosh sold for £ in the uk was described by jobs as the most important mac made by apple. mr jobs also unveiled the ipod shuffle a new music player using cheaper flash memory rather than hard drives which are used in more expensive ipods. the new computer shifts the company into new territory - traditionally the firm is known as a design and innovation-led firm rather than as a mass-market manufacturer. the mac mini comes without a monitor keyboard and mouse and a second version with a larger hard drive will also be sold for $. the machine - which will be available from january - was described by jobs as byodkm... bring your own display keyboard and mouse . in an attempt to win over windows pc customers mr jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems. people who are thinking of switching will have no more excuses he said. it s the newest and most affordable mac ever. the new computer has been the subject of speculation for several weeks and while few people will be surprised by the announcement many analysts had already said it was a sensible move. in january apple sued a website after it published what it said were specifications for the new computer. ian harris deputy editor of uk magazine mac format said the machine would appeal to pc-owning consumers who had purchased an ipod. they want a further taste of mac because they like what they have seen with ipod. harris added: everybody thought that apple was happy to remain a niche maker of luxury computers and moving into a market dominated by low margin manufacturers like dell is a bold move. but it shows that apple is keen to capitalise on the mass market success it s had with the ipod. the mac mini will appeal to pc users looking for an attractive no fuss computer. the new ipod shuffle comes in two versions - one offering of storage for $ (£ in the uk) and a second with one gigabyte of storage for $ (£) - and went on sale tuesday. the music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled. the smaller ipod will hold about songs said mr jobs. mr jobs told the delegates at macworld that ipod already had a % market share of all digital music players.
2169,goldsmith denies war advice claim the attorney general has denied his statement to parliament about the legality of the iraq war was drafted by downing street officials. lord goldsmith said lord falconer and baroness morgan played no part in drafting the answer. he added the answer represented his view that the war was legal but was not a summary of his advice to the pm. the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice saying such papers are always kept confidential. in a statement lord goldsmith said: i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised and of course approved the answer. he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman two of his own officials three foreign office officials a qc christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor lord irvine of lairg. no other minister or official was involved in any way. he suggested the claim that lord falconer and lady morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis-transcription of his evidence to the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence. as i have always made clear i set out in the answer my own genuinely held independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (un) security council resolutions he said. the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government. former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith s admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled. the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary but others certainly did he said. what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full accurate summary of his formal opinion. earlier tony blair dismissed questions about the attorney general s advice and said his parliamentary statement had been a fair summary of his opinion. that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue. on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential tory mp michael mates who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry told the bbc: that as a general rule is right but it s not an absolute rule. he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention he said. mr mates added: this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister. the claims about lord falconer and baroness morgan s involvement were made in a book published this week by philippe sands qc a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers. he also says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on march that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action. a short statement about lord goldsmith s position presented in a written parliamentary answer on march - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this. former minister clare short who resigned from the government over the iraq war said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she said the full advice should have been attached according to the ministerial code and demanded a lords inquiry into the matter. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell said lord goldsmith s statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues. if his original advice of march accepted that military action might be illegal how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the parliamentary answer was published on march he said. only the fullest disclosure will now do.
1795,us tv cuts nudity from bbc film a us tv network is editing bbc films dirty war to avoid showing the front of a nude woman being scrubbed down after a fictional chemical attack. it is not worth showing non-essential nude scenes when indecency complaints are aggressively pursued by us tv watchdogs said pbs jacoba atlas. dirty war - screened uncut on bbc one last september - depicts a dirty bomb attack on the city of london. it is also being screened uncut on us cable channel hbo on january. pbs said it will use extra footage for its broadcast showing the woman from a more discreet angle instead. the us federal communications commission fined cbs $ (£ ) last autumn for singer janet jackson s wardrobe malfunction during which her breast was exposed during a dance routine with justin timberlake. many us networks and broadcasters are now more nervous about airing nudity violence or bad language. ms atlas said pbs could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of dirty war and it could also deter many of its individual stations from airing an important film . you want to pick your battles she said. she added that pbs which is a private non-profit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation s public television stations is bolder about screening non-fiction or historical programming. pbs is seen in virtually all us homes with tv and describes itself as a trusted community resource serving nearly million people each week.
1811,takeover rumour lifts exel shares shares in storage and delivery firm exel closed up % at a two-and-a-half year high on tuesday on speculation it is to receive an imminent takeover bid. the talk in the city is that us giant united parcel services (ups) is the most likely bidder for the firm. yet other names mentioned in connection to buying exel are dhl-owner deutsche post and finance firm ge capital. with its shares closing tuesday at bracknell-based exel is currently valued at £.

791,uk heading wrong way says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said. britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a bossy interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded: britain is working don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year mr howard said. we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale the speed the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp. yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever. he went on to reflect on the values that most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election he pledged to turn these beliefs into reality and set out the choices he says are facing britain. how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them. the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives undermining enterprise and denying people choice. worst of all it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today. the tories he said can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance the respect for the rule of law the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change. this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months he said urging voters to hold him to account. but labour spokesman mr kemp said: it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on april not january. let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment % interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax. with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government of which he was a member inflicted upon the country.
17,connors boost for british tennis former world number one jimmy connors is planning a long-term relationship with the lawn tennis association to help unearth the next tim henman. the american spent three days at the lta s annual elite performance winter camp in la manga earlier this week. britain has the right attitude said connors. the more involved i can be with the lta the better. a short-term arrangement is just confusing. the kids will ask: what am i doing there lta chief executive john crowther added: the relationship that jimmy s already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we d like some more of it. we want to use jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship. the camp played host to more than leading senior and junior players including greg rusedski arvind parmar and anne keothavong. la manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best said connors speaking at queen s club in london. what impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had. it was interesting to me to see kids of with that desire and passion and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them. instilling the importance of work and practice is something you can t buy. they know what s been given to them and all they have to do is give back the effort and every minute of practice they were doing that. speaking from la manga lta performance director david felgate told bbc sport: jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches and very humble considering what he s achieved. he worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and he ll get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them. he made it clear from the word go he didn t want it to be short-term. this is a -week-a-year job for me it s my life and my passion and it s the same with the coaches. he respects that but he wants to be involved and have real input. and why would he stake his reputation on something that s not going to be successful connors has also agreed to commentate for the bbc at next year s wimbledon championships. he will work during the second week of the tournament.
470,citizenship event for touted citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their birthday charles clarke has said. the idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches inclusive citizenship particularly for ethnic minorities. a pilot scheme based on ceremonies in australia will start in october. mr clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. britain s young black and asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation s heritage as part of the government s new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their other cultural identities alongside being british. the launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in britain. on monday school inspection chief david bell accused some islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to british society. the muslim council of britain said ofsted boss mr bell s comments were highly irresponsible . the home office started work on its community cohesion and race equality strategy last year and the outcome launched on wednesday is called improving opportunity strengthening society . it is aimed at tackling racism exclusion segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. it represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups said a home office spokesman. it is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged. the spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease. it is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems the spokesman added. launching the initiative mr clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. he added: but while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare education or housing. this strategy sets out the government s commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society. some % of the uk population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the census. the downing street strategy unit in said people from indian and chinese backgrounds were doing well on average often outperforming white people in education and earnings. but those of pakistani bangladeshi and black caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites it said. the home office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. the programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools.
469,howard attacks cost of asylum michael howard has launched an attack on the cost of britain s chaotic asylum system under tony blair. the tory leader said english local authorities have spent more than £ - or £ per household - on asylum since labour won power in . mr howard is expected to tell activists in kent that voters tolerance and desire to help others are being abused. other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked tory plans for annual limits on numbers. mr howard said britain should take its fair share of the world s genuine refugees . the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz - where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others - has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution he was due to say. but if we are to fulfil responsibility we have to get a grip of the system. fair play matters. people want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused he said. and let s be clear. our asylum system is being abused - and with it britain s generosity. earlier this week mr howard said his party s plans to cut immigration were not racist arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. if elected his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. that prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled. if we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution then these policies will not provide a safe haven said hannah ward of the refugee council. if people turn up in the uk asking for help they will be turned away. michael howard s policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the uk. when it comes to costs then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers. so many of them are shown to be wrong - one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned rising to half for some nationalities. we need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much. tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans. by cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders they will actually make the problem worse said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was absolutely disgusting to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. on monday mr howard said: it s not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it.
1515,booming markets shed few tears the market former british government minister michael heseltine once said has no morality. and indeed stock exchange traders around asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week s disaster. stock markets in indonesia and india have hit all-time highs this week; even in sri lanka more comprehensively affected the main index has lost only % since the waves hit. bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. the msci world share index a measure of global stock market performance hit its highest level this week since early ; the bbc global has risen by % in the past week. and this at a time when - all sentiment aside - insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts. in fact the markets are being perfectly rational. for a start the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. the overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance: according to estimates from india only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies. indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates. and where insurance certainly is in place - in for example the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market rather than landing locally. second stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged. most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring jakarta stock exchange are in oil technology and financial services - none of which have been hit by the flooding. tourist businesses the most likely sufferers are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. those that are listed have suffered: confifi hotel holdings a small sri lankan tourism firm has halved in value this week. but there are winners as well as losers. asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities. in indonesia shares in state construction companies adhi karya and semen gresik have jumped sharply this week. more broadly the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact. according to the natural hazards research and applications information center at colorado state university there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression. the need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity; there is rarely the centre says any sort of rebuilding boom but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided. a study of the des moines floods from the disaster research center at the university of delaware* found that % of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster and another % felt themselves better off. although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale our research indicates that most businesses even those that are especially hard-hit do indeed recover the authors concluded. but disasters have a vast psychological impact and markets are driven by psychological factors. in particular many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events. in fact again the risks here are lower than they seem. even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $ trillion and rising. a series of recent shocks the colorado centre has argued have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens: market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. the trillion-dollar debts of japan s banks for example have had no effect on stock markets further afield than tokyo. and the us stock market was on its way down long before september ; it rose by % during the six months following the attacks. it is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings one bombay trader said this week. but the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected. business sense probably tends to overrule everything else.

337,yukos heading back to us courts russian oil and gas company yukos is due in a us court on thursday as it continues to fight for its survival. the firm is in the process of being broken up by russian authorities in order to pay a $ (£) tax bill. yukos filed for bankruptcy in the us hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit yuganskneftegas. the unit was however sold for $. to state oil firm rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted. yukos lawyers now say the auction violated us bankruptcy law. the company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets using all and every legal means. the company wants damages of $ claiming yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. judge letitia clark will hear different motions including one from deutsche bank to throw out the chapter bankruptcy filing. the german lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to gazprom the russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for yuganskneftegas. deutsche bank which is also an advisor to gazprom has called on the us court to overturn its decision to provide yukos with bankruptcy protection. lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify deutsche bank s business position analysts said. analysts are not optimistic about yukos chances in court. russian president vladimir putin and the country s legal authorities have repeatedly said that the us has no jurisdiction over yukos and its legal wranglings. on top of that the firm only has limited assets in the us. yukos has won small victories however and is bullish about its chances in court. do we have an ability to influence what happens we think we do said mike lake a yukos spokesman. the litigation risks are real said credit suisse first boston analyst vadim mitroshin the dispute with the russian authorities is partly driven by president putin s clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion.
1599,britons fed up with net service a survey conducted by pc pro magazine has revealed that many britons are unhappy with their internet service. they are fed up with slow speeds high prices and the level of customer service they receive. % of readers have switched suppliers and a further % are considering changing in the near future. it is particularly bad news for bt the uk s biggest internet supplier with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining. a third of the broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks tim danton editor of pc pro magazine. we expect these figures to leap in . every month the prices drop and more and more people are trying to switch he said. the survey found that bt and tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. some readers were offered a price drop just more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator making it hardly worth while swapping. other found themselves tied into -month contracts. broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers. % of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all. we discovered a huge variety of problems but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier said tim danton editor of pc pro. this breaks the code of practice but because that code is voluntary there s nothing we or ofcom can do to help he said. there is a vast choice of internet service providers in the uk now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages. with prices set to drop even further in coming months mr danton advises everyone to shop around carefully. if you just stick with your current connection then there s every chance you re being ripped off he warned.
1221,venezuela and china sign oil deal venezuelan president hugo chavez has offered china wide-ranging access to the country s oil reserves. the offer made as part of a trade deal between the two countries will allow china to operate oil fields in venezuela and invest in new refineries. venezuela has also offered to supply barrels of fuel oil a month to china. venezuela - the world s fifth largest oil exporter - sells about % of its output to the united states. mr chavez s administration which has a strained relationship with the us is trying to diversify sales to reduce its dependence on its largest export market. china s quick-growing economy s need for oil has contributed to record-high oil prices this year along with political unrest in the middle east and supply bottlenecks. oil prices are finishing the year roughly % higher than they were in january . in according to forecasts from the ministry of commerce china s oil imports will be tons up % on the previous year. china has been a net importer of oil since the mid s with more than a third of the oil and gas it consumes coming from abroad. a lack of sufficient domestic production and the need to lessen its dependence on imports from the middle east has meant that china is looking to invest in other potential markets such as latin america. mr chavez who is visiting china said his country would put its many of its oil facilities at the disposal of china. chinese firms would be allowed to operate mature oil fields in the east of venezuela which could produce more than one billion barrels he confirmed. the two countries will also continue a joint venture agreement to produce stocks of the boiler fuel orimulsion. mr chavez has also invited chinese firms to bid for gas exploration contracts which his government will offer next year in the western gulf of venezuela. the two countries also signed a number of other agreements covering other industries including mining.

1524,gerrard happy at anfield liverpool captain steven gerrard has reiterated his desire to stay at anfield and win trophies with the club. the -year-old england midfielder is determined to see out his contract despite reported interest from chelsea. he said: i m signed here for this season and another two so there is no situation. there s a lot of speculation but that s not down to me. as club captain all i want to do is help us get back up the table and into the champions league again. gerrard looked set to move to chelsea during the summer and speculation of a switch to stamford bridge has again arisen with the january transfer window approaching. he raised doubts about his reds future when he said he wanted the club to prove they were title challengers in the very near future or he might leave. liverpool boss rafael benitez has insisted that gerrard has promised him he wants to stay at anfield. benitez said: i said to steven that i was sure he wanted to stay here and he said i do . i then said to him look if you want to win titles you want medals and you want liverpool to have these things then i am going to need your help . i really think he wants to stay so now what we must do is make the squad stronger for him. meanwhile gerrard has urged the anfield board to sign real madrid striker fernando morientes in the january transfer window. morientes has already expressed a willingness to come to england. gerrard added: he s a great player. he scores goals in the league in cup competitions and also in the champions league. i don t think he d be able to play for us in europe this season but if we are able to get hold of him we d be getting ourselves a great player. he d have spanish coaches a spanish manager and we have got three or four spanish players here now so they ll help him settle in. rafael benitez knows what he wants and he knows how to strengthen the squad he s got and if the right players become available at the right price i am sure we will strengthen. it would certainly be nice to see a few new faces in january to freshen things up.
1513,robotic pods take on car design a new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by japanese car giant toyota. the company s vision for the single passenger in the century involves the driver cruising by in a four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet. both these prototypes will be demonstrated along with other concept vehicles and helper robots at the toyota stand at the expo in aichi japan in march . the models are being positioned as so-called personal mobility devices which have few limits. the open leaf-like i-unit vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year. built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes. the model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds. body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music. also on display at the show will be the egg-shaped i-foot . this is a two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick. standing at a height of well over seven feet (. metres) the unit can walk along at a speed of about ./h (.) and navigate staircases into the bargain. mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like legs that bend over backwards. they are clearly what we call concept vehicles innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production said dr david gillingwater from the transport studies group at loughborough university. they clearly have eye-catching appeal which is in part the name of the game here and are linked to the imac and ipod-type niche which apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years - new different hi-tech image conscious products. as always with these concept vehicles it is difficult to see who they would appeal to and what their role would be in the personal transport marketplace. the personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities. toyota s prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much us military research over the years and japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications. with an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population care giving and the military wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual s particular mobility needs. while toyota s prototypes are geared towards mass transport the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility. experts though are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area. those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance now and certainly in the future are the elderly and infirm people dr gillingwater told the bbc news website. you have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups. design considerations also exist. dr erel avineri of the centre for transport and society at the university of the west of england in bristol said: the design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled. for example one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up. it looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need. this and other human-factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered said dr avineri. in general introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades. elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation. this may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle. such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport. the concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions said dr gillingwater. what s their range how user-friendly will they really be what infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used. overall i think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions.

1607,hunt demo at labour meeting pro-hunt supporters are set to protest at labour s spring conference. the countryside alliance says it expects up to supporters to demonstrate against the hunting ban. they have agreed to keep to a demonstration site on the other side of the river tyne from the conference venue in gateshead. a bid to overturn the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales has begun in the court of appeal. the ban comes into force on february. the court of appeal is expected to rule early next week on whether the alliance s challenge has succeeded. richard dodd regional director of the countryside alliance said he expected between and supporters in tyneside to make their protest with hunt horns and placards. campaigners have been asked not to bring any animals or alcohol. mr dodd said he did not believe there would be any repeat of the trouble which marred the pro-hunt demonstration outside parliament in september. we are holding a static demonstration just to remind labour that we are not going away he said. northumbria police said the pedestrian millennium bridge by the demonstration site will be shut if necessary. but assistant chief constable david warcup has liaised with several protest groups and said all negotiations had gone well. fathers justice pensioners rights activists and stop the war campaigners were also expected to demonstrate during the three-day conference which starts on friday. pro-hunt campaigners claims the parliament act - which extends the right of the house of commons to overrule the house of lords - was itself invalid because it was never passed by peers. the high court last month ruled the act was valid and the proposed hunting ban was lawful. pro-hunt supporters formally launched their second legal challenge to the ban in london s high court on thursday. the countryside alliance has lodged papers seeking a judicial review on human rights grounds. animal welfare groups have welcomed the ban many of whom have campaigned for a ban for decades saying hunting is cruel and unnecessary.
1762,mps quiz aides over royal income senior officials at the two bodies generating private income for the queen and prince of wales are to be questioned by mps. aides from the duchy of lancaster and duchy of cornwall will appear before the commons public accounts committee. it has been reported they could be questioned about prince charles spending on camilla parker bowles. but bbc correspondent peter hunt said they are not responsible for how money is spent and may be unable to answer. duchy officials who will appear before the committee on monday are only responsible for generating money. the duchy of lancaster provides the queen s private income while the duchy of cornwall provides prince charles annual income. the duchy of cornwall is a -acre estate across counties and also includes residential properties shops offices stocks and shares. it was set up in by king edward iii to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. it covers the cost of the prince s public and private life - neither charles nor william and harry receive taxpayers money from the civil list. however the prince of wales did receive over £ from government departments and grants-in-aid in -. the duchy last year generated almost £. the prince has voluntarily paid income tax - currently % - since .
1678,williams says he will never quit defiant matt williams says he will not quit as scotland coach even if his side slump to a new low with defeat by italy at murrayfield. that would leave the scots as favourites to win the wooden spoon for the second year running. i have never quit anything in my life apart from maybe painting the kitchen he told bbc sport. the support we have been given from murrayfield in my whole time here has been %. williams has yet to experience an rbs six nations victory after seven attempts and scotland have lost of their games under his leadership. but he rejected the comparison made in some media sources with berti vogts recently sacked as scotland football manager after a poor run of results. how can a german football coach and an australian rugby coach have anything in common he asked. it is a bizarre analogy. it is so absurd that it borders on the humorous. williams insists that he is revelling in the pressure despite the possibility of a second six nations series without a victory. that is not beyond the realms of possibility he admitted. there s nothing much between the teams so we could win the next three games or lose them. but i actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach. it helps the team grow and helps you grow as a coach. we could have won in paris but for the last five minutes and now we have two defeats but we were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat italy too.

140,disaster claims less than $ insurers have sought to calm fears that they face huge losses after an earthquake and giant waves killed at least people in southern asia. munich re and swiss re the world s two biggest reinsurers have said exposure will be less than for other disasters. rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries and many of those affected will not have insurance analysts said. swiss re has said total claims are likely to be less than $ (£.). swiss re believes that the cost would be substantial but that it is unlikely to be in double-digit billions the financial times reported. munich re the world s largest reinsurance company said that its exposure is less than euros (£; $). at least countries have been affected with sri lanka indonesia india and thailand among the worst hit. the region s resorts and western tourists are expected to be among the main claimants. lloyds of london told the financial times it expected its exposure to be limited to holiday resorts personal accident travel insurance and marine risks . a spokeswoman for hanover re europe s fifth-largest reinsurance firm estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros. the company has paid out about million euros (£; $) to cover damage caused recently by four major hurricanes in the us. but insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the damage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming through. so many things are unclear it is just too early to tell said serge troeber deputy head of swiss re s natural disasters department. you need very complicated processes to estimate damages. unlike the hurricanes you can t just run a model. he anticipated that his own company s total claims would be less then those from the hurricanes which the company put at $. allianz a leading german insurer said it did not know yet what its exposure would be. however it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a significant impact on its business. zurich financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster. the impact on us insurance companies is not expected to be heavy analysts said. most us insurers have relatively little exposure to asia and those that do pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds. insured damage could be a fraction of the billions of dollars worth of destruction in sri lanka india thailand indonesia the maldive islands and malaysia said prudential equity group insurance analyst jay gelb. us insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure. it s more likely the bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] might have some exposure said paul newsome an insurance analyst at ag edwards & co. many of the affected countries such as indonesia sri lanka or the maldives do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters said a us-based insurance expert. early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including sri lanka india indonesia and thailand at about $ (£.) similar to the cash offered to central america after hurricane mitch. mitch killed about people and caused damage of about $ in . but the cost of the tsunamis on the individuals involved is incalculable. we cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages ... that have just been wiped out. hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone said jan egeland head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. tourists cutting short their holidays in affected areas may suffer a financial impact too. the association of british insurers warned that travel insurance does not normally cover cutting short a holiday. it said loss of possessions will usually be covered but the association stressed the importance of checking the wording of travel policies.
1938,labour seeks to quell feud talk labour s leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after mps criticised tony blair and gordon brown over reports of their rift. mr brown was joined at the launch by john prescott and alan milburn the man controversially put in charge of election planning by mr blair. a private meeting on monday saw normally loyal mps warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. it follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor. the event was the first time mr milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking mr brown s traditional poll planning role. but the pair chatted amicably and mr brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister mr brown replied: you can see that our record on the economy is about the british people trusting us to run the economy. he refused to comment on the new book saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. mr brown later told reporters: of course i trust the prime minister. downing street cited that comment when reporters suggested mr brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told mr blair: there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe . labour s new posters say britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the lowest unemployment for years and the lowest mortgage rates for years. they urge voters not to let the tories take things backwards. mr milburn promised a poll campaign which is upbeat confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country . conservative co-chairman liam fox derided the photo call saying: the show of unity was the worst acting i have seen since prisoner cell block h. labour had broken promises by raising taxes times and brought the slowest economic growth in the english-speaking world he said. the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday s meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made in journalist robert peston s new book. mr blair told mps and peers: i know from everyone here in cabinet and government nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need. labour s paul flynn said the pair had had a scorching from mps. on tuesday deputy prime minister mr prescott told bbc news: they told us very clearly it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line. the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war. mr blair then changed his mind in june after cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him writes mr peston. mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. of course as a waiter for years i have a professional ability here he joked.
362,japanese growth grinds to a halt growth in japan evaporated in the three months to september sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough. output in the period grew just .% an annual rate of .%. exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. the growth falls well short of expectations but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion. the economy had stagnated throughout the experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. one result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending. the effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery. but high oil prices have knocked .% off the growth rate while the falling dollar means products shipped to the us are becoming relatively more expensive. the performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year. the first quarter showed annual growth of .% with the second showing .% and economists had been predicting as much as % this time around. exports slowed while capital spending became weaker said hiromichi shirakawa chief economist at ubs securities in tokyo. personal consumption looks good but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the olympics. the amber light is flashing. the government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with japan s massive public debt.
490,giggs handed wales leading role ryan giggs will captain wales as he wins his cap in wednesday s friendly against hungary in cardiff. john toshack in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark. with the games he s played for united proportionately it doesn t seem that many for wales toshack said. but he s one of the greatest of all welsh internationals and on his cap it s appropriate he s captain. giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game but is now targetting playing for wales in the european championships. the manchester united wing revealed how club manager sir alex ferguson talked him into extending his wales career. i briefly discussed my international future with sir alex but he urged me to carry on giggs said. he feels like myself that i have no weight problems and keep myself fit so in three or four years time i will be able to play in the european finals if we get there. the manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because i am fit enough. giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former wales skipper gary speed and united team-mate paul scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. but giggs is now focussed on making the toshack era even more successful than the time hughes spent at the helm. the manchester united winger won his first cap as a -year-old in an away loss to germany and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of . with giggs leading wales out against hungary there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to speed. however toshack refused to reveal whether he sees giggs as a long-term option. for this particular game i think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain it s his cap and he s known for some time about that toshack said. on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes and giggs said: it s my cap and i am looking forward to it and i hope to play a lot more times from here on in. it s important to be here all the players feel the same. it s a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important. i see myself leading by example it is something i have taken on for wales as well as united these past few seasons. the way john is looking at things he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament the euro event. i have told john i will be around for the next european tournament by then i will be so hopefully i will still be okay. a lot can happen but i m hoping to be around. giggs own personal future at old trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract with manchester united offering one extra year and giggs seeking two. i have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment said giggs. it is an important period for the club and i am just concentrated on that. i ve heard the suggestions hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what i am looking for to get it sorted out. i m enjoying my football the way united have been playing and my own form you have to enjoy it. we have massive games coming up: manchester city this week then the everton cup tie followed by ac milan in the champions league and my first wales game under john toshack so it s an important time.

836,tsunami cost hits jakarta shares the stock market in jakarta has seen its biggest slide in a month after the country doubled the likely cost of rebuilding from the asian tsunami. the fall came as indonesia said it expected debt repayments of up to trillion rupiah ($.; £.) to be frozen to help pay for the recovery. by monday s close the jakarta stock exchange was down .% at .. bar a slight dip at the new year the jse had risen steadily by .% since the tsunami hit on december. construction and property companies in particular have gained ground although banks were among the main fallers on monday. so far more than people are believed to have been killed in indonesia the country closest to the earthquake which triggered the great wave. on friday the government said its five-year estimate of rebuilding costs for banda aceh province - much of which was flattened by the quake and the tsunami - was trillion rupiah ($.; £.) twice what it had previously estimated. that cost could be defrayed by temporary debt relief. on monday indonesian economy minister aburizal bakrie told reporters that the paris club group of creditor countries was expected to freeze - rupiah in payments due in and . we hope we can resume the repayments at least from mr bakrie said. french finance minister herve gaymard said on sunday that the paris club had already agreed to a moratorium on repayments for tsunami-hit countries ahead of its meeting on january.
403,russian oil merger excludes yukos the merger of russian gas giant gazprom and oil firm rosneft is to go ahead but will not include yugansk which was controversially bought last year. the merger backed by russian authorities will allow foreigners to trade in gazprom shares. gazprom chief alexei miller confirmed rosneft-owned yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off. under the agreement the state will get a controlling share of gazprom in exchange for rosneft. the state wanted to control gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade. speaking on ntv television which is controlled by gazprom mr miller added that yugansk which was swallowed up by rosneft late last year will operate as a separate state-owned oil firm headed by current rosneft chief sergei bogdanchikov. according to reports from russian news agency interfax the deal should go through in the next two to three months. obtaining majority control over gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in gazprom shares mr miller added. by opening up trading in gazprom to foreigners the firm will become a top emerging market play for traders. currently foreigners can only trade in gazprom via a small issue of london-listed proxy shares. this is positive news for the international investment community global asset management investment chief david smith said. the majority of investors are going to be happy he added. however analysts were disappointed that yugansk would not be included in the deal. yugansk is a heavy cashflow generator and would have been a much better asset for gazprom renaissance capital energy analyst adam landes told reuters news agency. but he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in gazprom. ultimately and industrially gazprom needs yugansk he added. analysts said the deal would give gazprom control of % of russia s total oil production an improvement on its current .% but still far less than the % share it would have gained had it also taken over yugansk. however the merged group will still remain outside russia s top five oil producers - led by lukoil with % of the market followed by tnk-bp which is half owned by bp and surgutneftegaz. instead the merged gazprom-rosneft group will rank alongside sibneft with % of the market. yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company in a disputed auction in december following what many thought was a politically-motivated attack on yukos. the shell company was then snapped up by rosneft. yukos unsuccessfully sought to halt the auction by applying for bankruptcy through the us courts. the unit was auctioned by russian authorities to help pay off a $. back-tax bill.
909,campaign cold calls questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls . the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people s voting intentions. the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. the information commissioner s office says surveys are allowed but there is a grey area if personal data is kept. telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service (tps) lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications. the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps. a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. but that did not happen for voter identification calls. when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said. so it is not covered by the telephone preference service. he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again. a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers. she said: we do apply tps but in line with the law. we would not do things that are not allowed in the law. a spokesman for the information commissioner s office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. but the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics not person by person. if a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing he said. the spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. the spokesman said there was no yes or no answer and the area was pretty grey . he added: if someone complained then we would investigate that. political parties are aware of the regulations. at the last by-elections we reminded them. lib dem chairman matthew taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal. he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls. i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner. mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.

626,businesses fail to plan for hiv companies fail to draw up plans to cope with hiv/aids until it affects % of people in a country new research says. the finding comes in a report published on thursday by the world economic forum harvard and the un aids agency. too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats said dr kate taylor head of the wef s global health initiative. nearly business leaders in countries were surveyed for business and hiv/aids: commitment and action dr taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as too little too late . the issue will be highlighted to business and world leaders at the world economic forum which meets in davos switzerland next week. the wef report shows that despite the fact that people contract hiv/aids every day concern among businesses has dropped by % in the last months. most (%) have no policies in place to address the disease. nor could over % of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of hiv among their staff. the un programme tackling aids unaids pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with hiv/aids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible. one company that does have a plan is anglo-american the international mining company which estimates an hiv prevalence of % among its -strong southern african workforce. over the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for hiv infection coupled with anti-retroviral therapy for employees progressing to aids. over % of the employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work. effective action on hiv/aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations said brian brink senior vice-president health at anglo-american. companies should encourage all workers to know their hiv status making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol he said. providing access to treatment is a critical part of this. across sub-saharan africa even in countries with an hiv prevalence of -% only around % of companies have formal hiv/aids policies in place according to the report. the gap is even wider in china ethiopia india nigeria and russia the so-called next wave countries which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new hiv/aids cases worldwide by . the report adds an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the hiv/aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting said david bloom professor of economics and demography at the harvard school of public health. the wef report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to hiv/aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them. a key priority in both high and low-prevalence settings said the wef is to establish a policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality.
401,progress on new internet domains by early the net could have two new domain names. the .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net s administrative body. the names are just two of a total of proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann. the other proposed names include a domain for pornography asia mobile phones an anti-spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture. the .post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices. the .travel domain would be used by hotels travel firms airlines tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. it is backed by a new york-based trade group called the travel partnership. icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. despite this initial approval icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. a similar proposal has been made many times in the past. but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. in icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. in total there are in excess of domain names and the majority of these are for nations. but domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous.
995,lasting influence of legend charles ray charles who has won a string of posthumous grammy awards belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music. his sound encompassed so many styles - blues gospel jazz rock n roll even country - and had a real impact on the nascent uk beat and r&b scenes. compared in stature to elvis presley by some commentators charles songs cast their spell on such stalwarts as joe cocker steve winwood eric burdon and van morrison. his influence has extended to contemporary artists such as norah jones with whom he recently recorded a duet. if james brown was the godfather of soul then ray charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. along with sam cooke he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south baptist church with the devil s music of r&b to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists. without charles it is hard to imagine the tear-stained atlantic r&b sound of aretha franklin otis redding or wilson pickett. he was also a talented jazz composer arranger and band leader playing at the newport jazz festival and carnegie hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as milt jackson and david fathead newman. unfortunately he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction which led to him being arrested in . his string of atlantic r&b successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock n roll greats including i ve got a woman (roy orbison elvis presley) and hallelujah i love her so (eddie cochran). after the exuberance of his signature song what d i say charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style recording hoagy carmichael s sentimental string ballad georgia on my mind and the upbeat hit the road jack. he also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of hank williams standards such as your cheating heart and you win again. more than years after its release his abc album modern sounds in country and western music is still regarded as a classic. his version of don gibson s i can t stop loving you topped the pop and r&b charts in the us. in he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album a message from the people. on it he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as stevie wonder james brown curtis mayfield and marvin gaye. more than years later he would embrace contemporary production with his album my world which featured hip-hop beats - although charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when charles died aged in june was one from his friend the producer quincy jones who described him as a brother in every sense of the word . there will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as ray charles did he said. former manfred mann singer paul jones who sang on hits such as come tomorrow and sha la la said charles was one of his heroes. i m quite sure my own writing was influenced by him he told bbc news online. i would put money on the proposition that ray charles will have an influence on music forever.
269,tories reject rethink on axed mp sacked mp howard flight s local conservative association has insisted he will not be its candidate at the general election. russell tanguay agent for arundel and south downs tories said mr flight was ineligible to be a candidate and the association was seeking a substitute. the news comes despite mr flight s allies saying they had enough support to hold a meeting to discuss his fate. mr flight landed in trouble over remarks on tory tax and spending plans. he quit as tory deputy chairman after apparently suggesting the tories planned extra spending cuts - but he wants to continue as an mp. tory headquarters says he cannot stand as a conservative candidate because he is no longer an approved candidate. mr tanguay backed that view on tuesday saying: howard flight is ineligible to stand as a conservative party candidate. the association is in the process of selecting a new candidate. but the local tory chairman made similar comments on friday and dissent continues. two local councillors who back mr flight met mr tanguay and the local association s chairman in arundel on tuesday afternoon but did not comment as they left the meeting. mr flight says he will not stand down as a candidate unless his local party instructs him to do so at an extraordinary general meeting (egm). the mp who is consulting his lawyers told bbc news: they selected me and they if you like dispose of me or keep me. mr flight s supporters also say they have the signatures needed to trigger the egm. at a news conference mr howard insisted he had played by the party s rules. the tory leader who argues he is ensuring honesty said: we do not say one thing in private and another thing in public. labour election campaign coordinator alan milburn said the tories were in turmoil because mr flight had exposed their hidden plans. the comments were not a one-off he said claiming mr howard and other senior tories were obsessively committed to cutting public spending. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said: whilst i disagree with howard flight s views it seems extraordinary to sack somebody for telling the truth. it has also emerged mr howard has suspended slough s constituency conservative association for refusing to deselect its candidate. adrian hilton was abandoned after suggesting the signing of the maastricht treaty under john major s government was an act of treason. the catholic herald also highlighted articles he wrote about the role of catholicism in the european union. mr hilton was chosen to fight the seat after the previous candidate robert oulds was sacked for being pictured with a range of guns and a hunting knife. slough conservative association has now been placed on support status and is being run from conservative campaign headquarters says a senior party spokesman. mr hilton on tuesday said he was considering taking legal action against his deposal. he said the local party had only learned of the final decision on the bbc news website on monday evening. there are people at central office who are behaving like little dictators and seemingly people who are ordinary members are being treated with contempt he said. the party says it did try to contact the local conservative chairman.
1398,beckham virus spotted on the net virus writers are trading on interest in david beckham to distribute their malicious wares. messages are circulating widely that purport to have evidence of the england captain in a compromising position. but anyone visiting the website mentioned in the message will not see pictures of mr beckham but will have their computer infected by a virus. the pernicious program opens a backdoor on a computer so it can be controlled remotely by malicious hackers. the appearance of the beckham windows trojan is just another example in a long line of viruses that trade on interest in celebrities in an attempt to fuel their spread. tennis player anna kournikova popstars britney spears and avril lavigne as well as arnold schwarzenegger have all been used in the past to try to con people into opening infected files. the huge amount of interest in mr beckham and his private life and the large number of messages posted to discussion groups on the net might mean that the malicious program catches a lot of people out. the public s appetite for salacious gossip about the private life of the beckhams might lead some into an unpleasant computer infection said graham cluley from anti-virus firm sophos. simply opening the message will not infect a user s pc. but anyone visiting the website it mentions who then downloads and opens the fake image file stored on that site will be infected. the program that installs itself is called the hackarmy trojan and it tries to recruit pcs into so-called bot networks that are often used to distribute spam mail messages or to launch attacks across the web. computers running microsoft windows nt and xp are vulnerable to this trojan. many anti-virus programs have been able to detect this trojan since it first appeared early this year and have regularly been updated to catch new variants.

1094,gold falls on imf sale concerns the price of gold has fallen after the international monetary fund (imf) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief. by revaluing its holdings the imf may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world s poorest nations. the plan was put forward by finance ministers over the weekend. the price of gold fell to $. an ounce in asia before rebounding slightly in early european trading. imf boss rodrigo rato was asked by ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves. he is expected to present his conclusions at an imf meeting in washington during april. whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the april imf meetings said john reade an analyst at ubs. the imf values its gold reserves at between $ and $ an ounce a price that was fixed in the and is about a tenth of the metal s current market value. the imf has tonnes of gold or about . ounces. bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the imf s balance sheet giving it more money to distribute. this idea has been put forward before but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty. this is the first time there has been a mention of the use of gold in a communiqu& for achieving debt relief said uk chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown. at their meeting in london finance ministers backed plans to write off up to % of the debts owed by some of the world s poorest countries. mr brown said the meeting would be remembered as the % debt relief summit . while debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda not everyone is convinced that selling imf gold is the best way forward. the us which can veto any plan to sell imf gold should it so choose said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem. the us is not convinced that s the necessary way to do it said treasury under secretary john taylor. canada a key gold producer also expressed reservations.
1514,apple laptop is greatest gadget the apple powerbook has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc. the laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs. the magazine has compiled an all-time top list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the zenith remote control at two. gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. the magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device . in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine. in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded. the oldest gadget in the top is the abacus which the magazine dates at a.d. and put in place. other pre-electronic gadgets in the top include the sextant from ( position) the marine chronometer from ( position) and the kodak brownie camera from ( position). the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top which also includes the first flash player (diamond multimedia) as well as the first successful digital camera (casio qv-) and mobile phone (motorola startac). the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number . sony s third entry in the top is the cdp- cd player from . who can forget the crystalline hiss-free blast of madonna s like a virgin emanating from their first cd player asked the magazine. karl elsener s knife the swiss army knife from is at number in the list. gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone () the nintendo gameboy () and the pulsar quartz digital watch (). the list also contains plenty of oddities: the pez sweet dispenser () toy tamagotchi () and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (). almost everyone has a mobile phone how many people own a powerbook or an ipod the findings of this magazine are not very convincing. what about the magnetic compass we still use it years after it was invented. i am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre. for example the sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas minidisc flash portable cd players etc. are really just improvements in technology. my favourite true gadgets are probably my portable minidisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing i use to froth up my coffee! calm down it s only in their opinion and any list that includes the taser in the top gadgets has to be suspect.... swiss army knife and no question about it. how many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as useful/popular you don t need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out! this list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the american authors and the overwhelmingly british responses. brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties sinclair; whilst the americans focus on apple tv remotes and tivo (which probably is rather obscure in europe). what about the soda stream. this gadget changed my pre-teen life. lap tops may enable you to think different but you cant use them to get busy with the fizzy how about astro wars one of the pioneers for computer games i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today! however tried it the other day and it was rubbish still a great gadget of its time. why worry about mobile phones. soon they will be subsumed into the pda s / laptops etc. what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. for it s time a technological marvel! sony net minidisc! it paved the way for more player to explode onto the market. i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it. a laptop computer is not a gadget! it s a working tool! the sinclair executive was the world s first pocket calculator. i think this should be there as well. how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors. are the people who created this list insane surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly. has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker an interesting list. of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early blessed the original noteboook pc - the tandy . the size of paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem. a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible. what s an apple powerbook it s out of date - not much of a gadget . surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves it has to be the mobile phone. no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time. the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule. the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in . a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off. all top are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anything else. i say this as the swiss army knife only made no . sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time. the first home machine with a true multi-takings os. shame the marketing was so bad!!! apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else. utter rubbish. yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets. but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. no competition. i d also put apple s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason. i only wish that vulcan inc s flipstart wasn t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top. how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise) what about radios and tvs the swiss army knife. by far the most useful gadget. i got mine years ago. still wearing and using it a lot! it stood the test of time. psion organiser series should be up there. had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable. case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first i think). great product innovation. the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile pc ! why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site it s obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that. the motorola startac should be number one. why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices. the psion series ! the first most practical way to carry all your info around... i too would back the sinclair spectrum - without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now. i d have put the mobile phone high up the list. probably a nokia model. sinclair spectrum - . it plugged into the tv. games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that s what i do for a living now. i wish more modern notebooks -- even apple s newest offerings -- were more like the . particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses. they re invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use. congratulations to apple a deserved win!

1340,open source leaders slam patents the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents. in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement. mitchell kapor chairman of the mozilla foundation warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future. linux is a freely-available alternative to microsoft s windows. it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees. the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made of its patents freely available. other companies are expected to follow suit. there are between and registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted. this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office. some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they can t afford to take them to court said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office. some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future. if totally pushed to the wall - because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software...of course they re going to unleash the wmds mr kapor is reported as saying. microsoft did not want to comment directly referring the issue instead to trade body intellect of which it is a member. as far as intellect is concerned open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems said spokeswoman jill sutherland. the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries and not be forced into using one or the other she added.
744,wal-mart fights back at accusers two big us names have launched advertising campaigns to set the record straight about their products and corporate behaviour. the world s biggest retailer wal-mart took out more than full page adverts in national newspapers. the group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals benefits package and promotion strategy. meanwhile drugs group eli lilly is planning a campaign against false claims about its product prozac. wal-mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the wall street journal using an open letter from company president lee scott saying it was time for the public to hear the unfiltered truth . there are lots of urban legends going around these days about wal-mart but facts are facts. wal-mart is good for consumers good for communities and good for the us economy mr scott said in a separate statement. its adverts - and a new website - outlined the group s plans to create more than us jobs in . wal-mart s average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of $. (£.) an hour while employees are offered health and life insurance company stock and a retirement plan the adverts say. unions accuse wal-mart of paying staff less than its rivals do with fewer benefits. in california the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business. lawmakers in the state are also examining allegations that the firm burdens the state with an unfair proportion of employee health care costs. i think they are going to have a tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people said larry bevington chairman of save our community - a group fighting to prevent wal-mart opening a store in rosemead california. wal-mart is also fighting two lawsuits - one accusing it of discriminating against women and another alleging it discriminates against black employees. meanwhile eli lilly is launching a series of adverts in a dozen major newspapers to present what is says are the true facts about its anti-depressant drug prozac. the move is in response to a british medical journal article that claimed missing lilly documents linked prozac to suicide and violent behaviour. in the averts entitled an open letter from chief executive sidney taurel the company says the article continues to needlessly spread fear among patients who take prozac . it was simply wrong to suggest that information on prozac was missing or that important research data on the benefits and possible side effects of the drug were not available to doctors and regulators the letter added. eli lilly s chief medical officer alan breier said that the article was false and misleading as the documents it referred to were actually created by officials at the us food and drug administration (fda) and presented to an fda meeting in . later fda medical advisors agreed the claims were based on faulty data and there was no increased risk of suicide.

232,reyes tricked into real admission jose antonio reyes has added to speculation linking him with a move from arsenal to real madrid after falling victim to a radio prank. the spaniard believed he was talking to real madrid sporting director emilio butragueno when he allegedly berated his team-mates as bad people . i wish i was playing for real madrid the -year-old told cadena cope. hopefully it could happen. i love the way madrid play. i m not happy with the way things are. the striker joined the gunners from seville for £ at the start of but it has frequently been reported that he is homesick. he began the season in superb form but has struggled to maintain his high standards as arsenal have gradually lost the premiership initiative to manchester united and chelsea. if i m not (playing for real) i m going to have to carry on playing with some bad people he added. i m sure there are none in the real dressing room. i m happy madrid is interested in me because it has always been my dream since i was little to play there. before the story surfaced reyes had moved to play down reports linking him with the spanish giants issuing a statement through arsenal describing the speculation as flattering . i have seen the stories in the media linking me with real madrid he had said on thursday lunchtime. but not only am i under contract at arsenal i am happy here and committed to helping the team win more trophies. butragueno meanwhile was angry at being impersonated by the radio disc jockey. it is a disgrace there is no foundation to this he said. he is an arsenal player and we have to be respectful. we have to be careful because of the rumours that appear in the news.
1396,bellamy fined after row newcastle have fined their welsh striker craig bellamy two weeks wages - about £ - following his row with manager graeme souness. but bellamy has not been put on the transfer list although he did not train with the first team on tuesday. magpies chairman freddy shepherd told the newcastle evening chronicle: it is not about money. it is about a player thinking he is bigger than this club. no individual is be it the chairman the manager or a player. souness dropped bellamy for sunday s game against arsenal claiming the welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position. when i heard what the manager was saying i was in shock bellamy said. i thought not only has he gone behind my back he s lying he said in response to souness remarks. and the wales international refused to apologise. i won t apologise because i have done nothing wrong he told the evening chronicle. there s no doubt about it i am out of here. the difficult relationship between souness and bellamy boiled over at the weekend and has led to a war of words in the media. bellamy s claim that souness had lied about the background to the bust-up was strongly denied by shepherd who accused the striker of cheating the club. i wish to put the record straight regarding the bellamy situation said shepherd. craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring was tight (on friday) but what he failed to reveal was that he had told other members of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury. when graeme discovered this he immediately ordered bellamy to attend a meeting in my office. at that meeting bellamy admitted to graeme and i that he had told the players that he was going to fake an injury in training and walk off. he also agreed at that meeting to apologise to his team-mates for his behaviour. he didn t do this which resulted in the action taken by the manager at the weekend which i fully support. in my book this is cheating on the club the supporters the manager and his own team-mates. he is paid extremely well and i consider his behaviour to be totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional. bellamy s latest outburst would appear to make his chances of a first-team recall remote. but even before newcastle said the player would not be sold bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in a transfer request. i don t want the fans to think for one minute that i wouldn t play for this club he said. i d play anywhere for this club even in goal. it s a very difficult situation for me at the moment but i d never ask to leave this club. this club means so much to me. i couldn t do it because i know i couldn t come back here and play against newcastle. it would hurt too much.

59,us regulator to rule on pain drug us food and drug regulators will decide on friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke. the food and drug administration (fda) advisory panel will give its verdict after hearing evidence for three days. the painkillers - called cox- inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as celebrex and vioxx. vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but merck said it would consider selling it if it gets fda approval. the fda has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks. putting vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug analysts said. merck voluntarily stopped sales of vioxx on september a move which caused the firm s fourth-quarter earnings to slide to $. (£) from $. a year earlier. merck s shares tumbled more than % on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of vioxx-related litigation. alarm bells were rung by a research note called approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least months. the cox- inhibitors were developed by drug companies including merck and pfizer because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers. pfizer is still selling its celebrex and bextra products though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart. merck s announcement of a possible reintroduction of vioxx caught analysts by surprise. merck s head of research peter kim said that it withdrew vioxx based on the information that was available to us at the time knowing there were alternative therapies . he went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports. given this new information its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in approve makes vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the us mr kim explained. on thursday david graham from the fda s office of drug safety told the advisory panel that there really doesn t appear to be a need for cox- inhibitors. according to calculations presented to the us senate by dr graham in november vioxx may be linked to as many as to american deaths. facing stem criticism for its handling of the vioxx case the fda said on tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place. european regulators meanwhile ruled on thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take cox- inhibitors. the european medicines agency also said doctors should be cautious about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease.
1748,id theft surge hits us consumers almost a quarter of a million us consumers complained of being targeted for identity theft in official figures suggest. the federal trade commission said two in five of the reports it had from consumers concerned id fraud. id theft occurs when criminals use someone else s personal information to steal credit or commit other crimes. internet auctions were the second biggest source of fraud complaints comprising % of the total. the total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $ (£). the report marks the fifth year in a row in which identity fraud has topped the table. the biggest slice of the id fraud cases reported - almost % - concerned abuses of people s credit. misusing someone s identity to claim new credit cards or loans comprised .% of the total with almost % coming from false claims on existing credit. another % came from attempts to rip off people s bank accounts while % of cases concerned attempts to defraud employers by abusing someone else s identity. outside the field of id theft % of the near- complaints were internet-related. among the internet auction complaints the failure of sellers to deliver or the supply of sub-standard goods were the most common woes reported. catalogue and home-shopping frauds were next in line accounting for % of total complaints while concerns about internet services and computers - including spyware found on people s pcs and undisclosed charges for websites - amounted to % of complaints.
257,sporting rivals go to extra time the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on-field action without ever moving from the couch. the two giants in the field - espn and ea sports - have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years. the latter is the world s largest games manufacturer. years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed massively entertaining and ooze flair. sports broadcaster espn meanwhile has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price. but that status quo was changed forever - or for the next years at least - by a deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and on-air talent meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form. it was a massive-money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters with fans concerned that it is set to enable ea to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree. some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than virtual signatures. many of those clicking to complain were already rankled for the espn coup happened just weeks after ea had pulled off another enormous licensing deal controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from america& national football league (nfl). so will the sega - espn range be missed a key reason for answering yes is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste and having some options available always proves hugely handy. online soccer fans will testify to that between bouts of arguing over which high-profile title rules supreme out of the similar-yet-hugely-different fifa and pro evolution soccer . on the same note the espn and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements. taking hockey and basketball as examples both publishers efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible. they also both look awesome with the sega / espn versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front. in terms of gameplay i marginally preferred ea s nba live for basketball and was more satisfied ice hockey-wise by espn s nhl . the espn games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into although like their rivals they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans. perhaps the most interesting aspect of the espn deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of ea s future titles. the front-end decoration of ea s games has become something of an art-form in itself loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music. they are also immediately identifiable as coming from the ea stable and the inevitable compulsion to add an espn look will no doubt change that in various ways. what is a shame is that the espn titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting - their preambles look and sound much like they would on tv. they are neat and excellent-value games in their current form and combining them with ea s own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast.
260,ukip outspent labour on eu poll the uk independence party outspent both labour and the liberal democrats in the european elections new figures show. ukip which campaigned on a slogan of say no to europe spent £. on the campaign - second only to the conservatives £.. the campaign took ukip into third place with an extra meps. labour s campaign cost £. the lib dems £. and the greens £ according to figures revealed by the electoral commission on wednesday. much of the ukip funding came from yorkshire millionaire sir paul sykes who helped bankroll the party s billboard campaign. critics have accused the party of effectively buying votes. but a ukip spokesman said labour and the conservatives had spent £ between them on the last general election. with the advantages of public money the others have the only way the smaller parties can get their message across is by buying the advertising space he added.
1527,pm apology over jailings tony blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the uk s biggest miscarriages of justice. the prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of people for ira bomb attacks on pubs in guildford and woolwich in . mr blair said: i am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice. he made the apology to members of the conlon and maguire families in his private room at westminster. in a statement recorded for television mr blair said the families deserved to be completely and publicly exonerated . the families had hoped the apology would be made during prime minister s questions in the house of commons. however one of the so-called guildford four gerry conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. he said mr blair had spoken with such sincerity adding: he went beyond what we thought he would he took time to listen to everyone. you could see he was moved by what people were saying. tony blair has healed rifts he is helping to heal wounds. it s a day i never thought would come. the move followed a huge campaign in ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the ira bombs which killed seven people. mr blair s official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister s statement brought to them . most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. all were arrested because of a family connection to gerry conlon. mr conlon s father giuseppe was arrested when travelling to london from belfast to help his son. he died while serving his sentence. also arrested were anne maguire and members of her family. mrs maguire was the relative with whom giuseppe planned to stay in london as well as two family friends. she said it was a wonderful feeling to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. the people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent she said. they were all jailed for handling explosives based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. in october the court of appeal quashed the sentences of the guildford four and in june it overturned the sentences on the maguire seven. mr conlon s case was highlighted in the oscar-nominated film in the name of the father starring daniel day-lewis.
1522,fed chief warning on us deficit federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned that allowing huge us budget deficits to continue could have severe consequences. speaking to the house budget committee he urged congress to take action to cut the deficit such as increasing taxes. while the us economy is growing at a reasonably good pace he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the us. pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy he said. the government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby-boom generation retires. i fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. if existing promises need to be changed those changes should be made sooner rather than later mr greenspan said. he also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity retirement and health programmes would need significant changes. he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford. meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending he added. he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red. despite the dire warnings mr greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. as us growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely which should cut some costs. since president george w bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $ last year.

1056,wenger steps up row arsene wenger has stepped up his feud with sir alex ferguson by claiming the manchester united manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute. the pair s long-running row was put back in the headlines on saturday when ferguson said his arsenal counterpart was a disgrace . wenger initially refused to bite back saying only: i will never answer any questions any more about this man. but now he claims ferguson should be punished by the football association. the latest twist in the ferguson-wenger saga came on saturday when the united boss in an interview with the independent newspaper discussed the events after the game between the two sides in october. united won - that day at old trafford but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw ferguson s clothes covered in soup and pizza. the sides meet again at highbury on february. in the tunnel wenger was criticising my players calling them cheats so i told him to leave them alone and behave himself ferguson said on saturday. he ran at me with hands raised saying what do you want to do about it to not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable. it s a disgrace but i don t expect wenger to ever apologise he s that type of person. those allegations were put to wenger after saturday s game at bolton which arsenal lost to slip points behind chelsea in the title race. at first he said only: i ve always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened. if he has to talk he talks. if he wants to make a newspaper article he makes a newspaper article. he doesn t interest me and doesn t matter to me at all. i will never answer to any provocation from him any more. he does what he likes in england anyway. he can go abroad one day and see how it is. but later on saturday according to the independent wenger spoke to a smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction. i have no diplomatic relations with him the arsenal boss is quoted as saying. what i don t understand is that he does what he wants and you (the press) are all at his feet. the situation (concerning the food fight) has been judged and there is a game going on in a month. the managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game. but in england you are only punished for what you say after the game. now the whole story starts again. i don t go into that game. we play football. i am a football manager and i love football above all ... no matter what people say. reminded that ferguson called him a disgrace wenger added: i don t respond to anything. in england you have a good phrase. it is bringing the game into disrepute . but that is not only after a game it is as well before a game. ferguson had also claimed that united chief executive david gill and arsenal vice-chairman david dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public. but ferguson added: in the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense. gill phoned dein three times to complain but nothing was done. the return is on february and they will come out with another diatribe. david gill and i feel we should set the record straight because arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here. meanwhile the league managers association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on-going row. during that stormy game in october united striker ruud van nistelrooy caught arsenal s ashley cole with one particularly strong tackle. wenger later accused van nistelrooy of cheating and was fined £ and severely reprimanded by the football association. ferguson admitted on saturday that van nistelrooy s tackle which earned the dutchman a ban could have given (cole) a serious injury but he believes arsenal were the main aggressors. wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit he added. they are the worst losers of all time they don t know how to lose. maybe it is just manchester united they don t lose many games to other teams. we tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was arsenal s up until last season. in fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue. but to wenger it never happens it is all some dream or nightmare.
1071,tories plan migrant health checks non-european union citizens wanting to work in the uk will have to undergo tests for tuberculosis and hiv under plans unveiled by the conservatives. a positive test for tb would mean visa applications being turned down while hiv would be dealt with case by case. leader michael howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the nhs. labour said many tests were already done. the lib dems warned both parties against pandering to prejudice . the proposals which would be brought in if the conservatives won the general election would not apply to people coming to the uk for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. mr howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in canada new zealand and australia. it s very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that britain enjoys he told bbc radio s today programme. government figures suggest tb in england has increased by % over the past years. nearly two thirds of people with tb are born abroad said mr howard. i don t think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem. but mr howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants claims. the proposals include: - people coming to the uk from outside the eu for between six and months from a high incidence tb country will have to undergo a chest x-ray. - people coming to settle in the uk permanently from outside the eu will have to demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health . - they will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to impose significant costs or demands on the nhs. - the tests will include a health check chest x-rays for tb (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and hiv for over -year-olds. only the discovery of tb will mean people will be automatically denied a visa other conditions will be dealt with on a case by case basis . there is already some screening in place. last year people were tested for tb at heathrow and gatwick airports only about were found to be infected. and dr john moore-gillon of the british lung foundation said: tb is not simply imported we are seeing a rise in many sections of the uk-born population as well. the government says the tories are a bit late to the issue. immigration minister des browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum as saying: we are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for tb in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage. those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk. meanwhile mark oaten liberal democrat home affairs spokesman said: this is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between labour and the conservatives. michael howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing and history proves it is a very dangerous one. lisa power head of policy at aids charity the terrence higgins trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based. in fact it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their eu status she said.

646,gritty return for prince of persia still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year s sands of time the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within and in a more bellicose mood than last time. this sequel gives the franchise a grim gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence. as before you control the super-athletic prince from a third-person perspective. the time-travelling plot hinges on the dahaka an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages. the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast s creation. studiously structured though this back story is everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves on the whole as dependable as it needs to be. ever since the series then-groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga prince of persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies body parts. those flashy moves are back in full evidence and tremendous fun to perform and perfect. combining them at speed is the best fun although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill. until you reach that point it is a haphazard business. all too often you will perform a stunning triple somersault pirouette off a wall knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom. that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path. the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct but combat is what is really been stepped up and there is more of it than before. the game s developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways. slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off. warrior within is a very slick package; the game s intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences. it is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of onimusha earlier this year and when the game begins it is something of an anti-climax. that said the graphics are excellent and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game. the music is probably the worst aspect - a merit-free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off. there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game. perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be. somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable. but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy. it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for.
534,scots smoking ban details set out smoke-free areas will save lives and improve scotland s health first minister jack mcconnell has insisted. he told the scottish parliament on wednesday that a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of . mr mcconnell said the country s health rates were lamentable not least because of smoking. he said fines of up to £ would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. earlier the scottish executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. in a statement to parliament mr mcconnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force. the health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost he told msps. he said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of europe image becomes a thing of the past . there are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health he declared. health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise drugs abuse excessive drinking and over-eating. they all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in europe and too many smoke. it is clear that scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking. the legislation will be introduced as part of the health service (miscellaneous provisions) bill which will be considered by parliament before christmas. main points of the plan: - a comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in scotland - the legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers - licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £ - licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence - a system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined - individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £ . mr mcconnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. he said there had been falling cigarette sales of % in new york and % in ireland. mr mcconnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from new york bars and restaurants and in ireland only a one point three per cent volume sales fall where they were declining before the ban. the afternoon announcement following a cabinet meeting on wednesday morning won broad support from opposition parties. the scottish national party s holyrood leader nicola sturgeon welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. she said: the time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. there is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the % of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. but we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded. the scottish conservative party leader david mcletchie questioned what would be exempted from the ban. he was keen to know if inmates in scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. mr mcletchie asked: would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister s brave new scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals the scottish green party s health spokeswoman eleanor scott said she was pleased scotland would be following the success stories of new york and ireland . she believed the majority of people in scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.

2084,franz ferdinand s art school lesson scottish rock band franz ferdinand who shot to prominence in have won two brit awards. with their self-titled debut franz ferdinand have achieved what most rock bands crave - high credibility and critical acclaim while also selling stacks of cds. they have risen to the head of the uk s art rock ranks with an album of songs that are catchy creative and original enough to sound fresh. with a cool spiky fun sound previously associated with bands like talking heads they hit upon a style that had been out of fashion for a while and so was ripe for another airing. their first uk single hit number three last january followed by two more top hits while the album has sold more than copies in months on release. in september it was named album of the year winning the prestigious mercury music prize. on the festivals circuit they have been one of the main attractions for huge crowds at glastonbury t in the park and reading/leeds. they have also found success in japan europe and the us. by september the album had sold in the states and total sales were pushing two million worldwide. they have been nominated for three grammy awards in the us as well as the us music industry s shortlist award but lost the shortlist prize to us band tv on the radio. nevertheless franz ferdinand were the only uk band to win an mtv video music award this year taking the breakthrough video crown for take me out. the four-piece met two years ago when drummer paul thomson was working at the glasgow art school where bassist bob hardy was studying. singer alex kapranos was studying english at university but had friends at art school and the line-up was completed when guitarist nick mccarthy moved from munich germany to the city. at the turn of the year kapranos told bbc news online the band were fed up with serious bands in that post-rock thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune . we want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing. but at the same time bringing an edge to it. franz ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song kapranos said. where s the fun in that they pondered at every stage making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors. the band started out with a diy ethic that saw them take over a disused art-deco warehouse in glasgow and rename it the chateau. the venue soon became legendary - so well-known that the police spent a month trying to find it eventually raiding it and arresting kapranos. but the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped. the band took over an abandoned victorian courtroom and jail instead and named that the chateau. the buzz about the band soon spread around the music industry and record labels turned up to one gig in glasgow - which the band thought was totally ridiculous . i m really glad it was almost comical because we weren t overwhelmed by the seriousness of it kapranos said. they signed with independent label domino home of smog sebadoh and four tet in june .
1873,bank voted - for no rate change the decision to keep interest rates on hold at .% earlier this month was passed - by the bank of england s rate-setting body minutes have shown. one member of the bank s monetary policy committee (mpc) - paul tucker - voted to raise rates to %. the news surprised some analysts who had expected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision. worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates the minutes showed. the bank s latest inflation report released last week had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending. however mpc member paul tucker voted for a quarter point rise in interest rates to %. he argued that economic growth was picking up and that the equity credit and housing markets had been stronger than expected. the bank s minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were sufficiently to the downside to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting. however the minutes added: some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection . ross walker uk economist at royal bank of scotland said he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon. he said the minutes appeared to be trying to get the market to focus on the possibility of a rise in rates . if the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates. however he added any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year with mpc members likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting.
631,dollar gains on greenspan speech the dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the federal reserve head said the us trade deficit is set to stabilise. and alan greenspan highlighted the us government s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. in late trading in new york the dollar reached $. against the euro from $. on thursday. market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. on friday federal reserve chairman mr greenspan s speech in london ahead of the meeting of finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected us jobs data. i think the chairman s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he s taken for some time said robert sinche head of currency strategy at bank of america in new york. he s taking a longer-term view laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next. worries about the deficit concerns about china do however remain. china s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the us currency s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made chinese export prices highly competitive. but calls for a shift in beijing s policy have fallen on deaf ears despite recent comments in a major chinese newspaper that the time is ripe for a loosening of the peg. the meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in chinese policy. in the meantime the us federal reserve s decision on february to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with european rates. the half-point window some believe could be enough to keep us assets looking more attractive and could help prop up the dollar. the recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits as well as the us s yawning current account gap both of which need to be funded by the buying of us bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. the white house will announce its budget on monday and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.
1878,wales hails new superstar one game into his six nations career and gavin henson is already a welsh legend. a mesmeric display against england topped off by his howitzer of a match-winning penalty has secured life membership of that particular club. at henson has the rugby world at his silver-booted feet. and if his natural self-assurance and swagger is shared by his wales team-mates then a full-blown revival could be more than just a lot of hot air drifting up from the valleys. the red dragonhood subdued the red rose army in most areas of the field but henson s stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others. he announced himself in the game s opening salvo with a welcome to cardiff greeting for mark cueto on the gain line. and his defence was a major feature of the match his principal victim poor old or rather young mathew tait. the england centre will have spent his birthday on sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up-ended not just once but twice by henson s all-enveloping tackles. the second time after the interval single-handedly lifted the record millennium stadium crowd at a time when england were starting to show menace. showing awesome strength henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid-air a master predator toying with his helpless prey savouring the kill. his kicking game also prospered particularly when he moved to full-back for minutes either side of half-time when his captain gareth thomas was in the sin-bin. one huge clearance from tait s kick sent england retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half. henson was also creativity personified: one little chip ahead for shane williams narrowly missed its target; a precise cross-kick forcing jamie noon to fumble the ball into touch. he also had a hand in the game s only try finished superbly by williams and might have scored himself on the half-hour as he glided into space only to be scragged by tait. henson was twice repelled as wales laid siege to the english line after charlie hodgson s penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time. but he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to a deafening din and the outcome of the match fell to him. replacement gareth cooper made the most of a poor welsh scrum by chipping into space where jason robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle. five metres in from the right touchline metres out it was not a kick stephen jones who had seen a long-range effort fall agonisingly under the bar would have approached with confidence. it was out of steve s range but i looked at gavin and he gave me a reassuring nod said thomas. henson surveying his date with destiny positively relished the responsibility and the chance to make himself a hero. without further ado he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of english dominance and years of waiting in cardiff. i knew i was going to get it before i even took the kick he said later his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape. i have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasn t a problem. there were still four minutes for wales to hold out and the frenzy was such that henson could not even hear jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away. but it was wales who finished the game on the attack almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax. just do it implored the front page headline on saturday s western mail newspaper. and thanks to henson wales did.
881,uk youth interested in politics the majority of young people are interested in politics holding strong opinions on policies and have a keen appetite for direct action. research undertaken for voting watchdog the electoral commission suggests % of to -year-olds feel strongly about issues like crime and education. the survey findings are being released to coincide with the launch of the y vote mock elections initiative. mock elections are planned to take place in schools across the uk. electoral commission boss sam younger said: we know that young people often feel disengaged from democratic life and we believe in working creatively to encourage their interest and participation. mock elections can play an extremely valuable role in helping young people understand how the democratic process works and why it matters he said. the survey of a sample of british to -year-olds and to -year olds showed britain s young people are far from apathetic about issues that matter to most of their lives . the y vote initiative is being run jointly by the electoral commission the hansard society and the department for education and skills in the run-up to local elections and the general election possibly on may. michael rafferty who is mock elections project manager at the hansard society said he looked forward to seeing schools and colleges across the uk participating in the mock votes.

best song in years you must be joking. its good if you like that sort of thing but really! listened to angels on radio this morning when i was driving into work. had not heard it for a while. i love robs voice the lyrics and tune. perfection! as usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest . there must be more than a dozen songs in the last years that deserve this award more. it s not exactly groundbreaking. presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low... i m actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last years!! what about the specials - ghost town the buzzcocks - ever fallen in love with someone... happy mondays - kinky afro mcalmont & butler - yes joy division - love will tear us apart... angels is middle-of-the-road rubbish. angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap. it s musically and lyrically inept; and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself. this result isn t very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music! best of the last years maybe. cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really. not much competition in the last years after all. it s alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last years there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last years....it s a travesty. rubbish! who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio but i don t recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn t know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last years. how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out - where on earth did this dreadful list appear from while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last years should not include songs less than years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty. then again well done robbie good show. you ve got to be kidding. angels is a great song but not the best song of the last years. only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits. i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don t think its the best song from the past years! right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn t that good! i m happy for robbie himself though! best song in the last years what a joke! think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the and pretty much all of them are better than angels. phil collins doesn t deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it. soppy rubbish at best. hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards. so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me it s proof that music and democracy just don t mix. still at least it wasn t will young... oh it s all just a bit of fun. people take these awards too seriously! robbie has millions of loyal fans while even non-fans know the words to angels. him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards. personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talent! i hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with! i agree about angels. i never get fed up hearing it. whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along (very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out). the song makes me calm and serene and happy. well done robbie. i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isn t really that good a song. it certainly isn t anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush. angels is a fantastic song. all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers. it s a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups. robbie did in no way deserve that mantle. whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...we forget about the late and early for example. they weren t cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think. yes angels is the best song since the past years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning. i ve always disliked angels intensely. i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre-teens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality/ low aspirational music as classic songwriting. it s orrible. it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don t particularly like music all that much. folks without collections; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music. angels adds nothing - it is merely an irritating distraction - a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer s afternoon picnic. what a dreadful result. if you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don t you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote. booo hisss angels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but no way. did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century. no surprise about robbie williams considering the list. where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps i mean will young come on. what a load of crap best song in the last years - i don t think so!! what about all the real artists out there over the last years - the list is endless but robbie williams doesn t even come close. what a joke. that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radio s off . why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom) should be voted the best song of the past years is beyond me. if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up. why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last years!!!! i think not i didn t realize radio had so many listeners under the age of !! people have such short memories! a great song yes but the best of the last years not a chance. i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here. the great british public at work again. it s a mediocre sentimental and safe song. granted it s not too bad either. but can it stand up against anything by the smiths (in particular how soon is now ) or anything from the stone roses first album nope. no because i m not female and i m not ! ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song. but it is no way the best song of the past years! the shortlist wasn t great but him winning it is a joke! predictable and laughable. the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last years. the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed. whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie s repertoire never mind best song of the last years. i am a huge robbie fan and love that song. but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list. have radio listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last years than robbie williams ever will. no doubt about it. there s not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling. some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song. it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song. i sincerely do not believe that in years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today. yes!! i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people. there were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win! robbie was a deserved winner. i am astounded that such a second-rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs! it s a terrible song voted for by the masses who don t have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music. the best song of the past years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down... it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division. i suppose it s confirmed one thing - the british public are consistently dull :- &lt;( no offence robbie but pleeease! there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids. no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin! i think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide. anybody who says he doesn t deserve it is jealous of his success. the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dust!! obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it. if this is the best song of the last years then the british music industry is in trouble. sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record. a sad day for music it s not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people. that s why it has been voted best song of the last years. it s a good all-rounder. just like robbie. best song in years since i m confused. angels isn t a bad song. it s a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes. but this is not great music. if anything it s regressive. bland even. i suppose it s just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become. granted angels is a good song however it really wasn t up against any other proper competition. the queen s song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic! also why weren t the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn t getting more awards so they had to make one up for him! best song of the last years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner. sigh. on the upside at least it wasn t bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful. angels is without doubt a great song but i really don t think it deserves the title of best song in years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song!!! don t get me wrong i m not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners. it would have been a travesty had angels not won. without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists. it has to be seen performed live with people singing along to be fully appreciated. well done rob. i find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past years! i m rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning . what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp... not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different. why must best always come down to most commercially popular i ve nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales. the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near s new record neither are they in the same league. once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit. no surprise really it s voted for by the general public. since when did they have taste in music personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard! it absolutely deserved to win. it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come. it s an absolute joke however most of the original were very poor choices as well. all in all a pretty pointless exercise ! the song is overplayed and oversentimental. out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen. i suppose we should be thankful that it didn t end up in the hands of will young though. although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win. everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares u etc. much better songs and more timeless. give it to someone with real talent. although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last years. this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye. why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that s all it means!

1857,parliament s record of scandal in a locked room at the heart of parliament there is a hive of scandal. sex betrayal and custody of children are all there in this affair but this time it has nothing to do with the recent troubles of david blunkett or boris johnson. few realise that westminster in effect has its own divorce den. for sprinkled among floors of archives are blow-by-blow accounts of marital break-ups - and now you can search what s there online. until the only way in england to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an act of parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty. the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings dating back to all recorded among the items which fill the floors of the parliamentary archives in parliament s victoria tower. most people researching their family history want to discover some tale of illicit love. this gives them the chance. divorce by parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses. among the records is the story of jane campbell the first woman ever to divorce her husband. that happened in after she had discovered her husband edward addison had committed adultery with her sister jessy. a transcript of evidence from jessy s maid amelia laugher shows her telling how addison frequently passed by her on the way to the room where she had just put her mistress naked to bed. it must have been a killer blow to addison s case - he had already fled abroad rather than pay the £ damages ordered by a civil court. as well as making divorce history jane campbell won custody of her children - unusual for a woman at the time. but divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and parliament. there are the protestation returns from - lists of the protestants who pledged to maintain the true reformed protestant religion . there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament including composer george frideric handel in . and the mass of private bills which for example authorise the building of railways and roads contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them. tax bills may be an extra source for pedigree hunters - the longest stretches for about and is longer than the palace of westminster itself listing the names of appointed tax collectors. this wealth of material has long been open to the public at the house of lords record office with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room. but now five years of work has produced an online catalogue. david prior assistant clerk of the archives says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research. before you just could not do it you faced trawling through pages and pages of printed material he says. mr prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally. the archive profession may look fairly staid but is in an enormous period of change mainly motivated by the potential of it which is opening up all sorts of vistas for us he says. the archives do of course hold records of high (and low) politics too for both houses of parliament including copies of all acts passed since - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk. records for the commons only date back to - anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the parliament buildings in . but that still leaves some of the most important documents of uk political history - parts of the bill of rights from the death warrant for charles i the private papers and diaries of major politicians such as david lloyd george and andrew bonar law. there is also the act establishing november as a thanksgiving day - the year after the gunpowder plot. that document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across london to mark the anniversary of guy fawkes conspiracy. as mr prior remarks as we walk by shelf after shelf of vellum (parchment made from goat s skin): all human life is here.
993,us hacker breaks into t-mobile a man is facing charges of hacking into computers at the us arm of mobile phone firm t-mobile. the californian man nicholas lee jacobsen was arrested in october. mr jacobsen tried at least twice to hack t-mobile s network and took names and social security numbers of customers said a company spokesman. the arrest came a year after t-mobile uncovered the unauthorised access. the us secret service has been investigating the case. t-mobile has stringent procedures in place where we monitor for suspicious activity so that limited his activities and we were able to take corrective action immediately peter dobrow a t-mobile spokesperson said. it is thought that mr jacobsen s hacking campaign took place over at least seven months during which time he read e-mails and personal computer files according to court records. although mr jacobsen managed to get hold of some data it is thought he failed to get customer credit card numbers which are stored on a separate computer system said mr dobrow. t-mobile confirmed that the us secret service was also looking into whether the hacker accessed photos that t-mobile subscribers had taken with their camera phones. the associated press agency reported that mr jacobsen also read personal files on the secret service agent who was apparently investigating the case. a los angeles grand jury indicted mr jacobsen with intentionally accessing a computer system without authorisation and with the unauthorised impairment of a protected computer between march and october . he is currently on bail. t-mobile is a subsidiary company of deutsche telekom and has about . million subscribers in the us.

309,iraq advice claim sparks new row the tories say ministers must respond in parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the iraq war was drawn up at number . downing street has denied the claims made in a new book about the attorney general lord goldsmith s advice. lord goldsmith also denied them saying he was not leaned on in any way. but the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. the government has consistently refused to publish lord goldsmith s advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. but a short statement about lord goldsmith s position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on march - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. it said it was plain iraq continued to be in material breach of un resolution . in his new book lawless world philippe sands a qc and international law professor suggests the parliamentary answer was written in downing street. according to mr sands lord goldsmith had warned tony blair in a document on march that the use of force against iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second un resolution sanctioning military action. mr sands told newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case in case legal action was taken against the uk over the war. on march military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law. the book being serialised in the guardian newspaper says on march lord goldsmith met then home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan. after that downing street proceeded to set out his [lord goldsmith s] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on march said mr sands. tory leader michael howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general warning: this issue will not go away. these revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates - even on an issue as important as peace and war. the government needs to act to restore public confidence and trust. liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell repeated his party s calls for lord goldsmith s first piece of legal advice to be made public. the public interest which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice can only be served now by the fullest disclosure. in a statement to newsnight lord goldsmith said: in my parliamentary answer on march i explained my genuinely held independent view that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions. it was certainly not a view that i expressed as a result of being leaned on in any way nor as i have already made clear was it written by or at number . the prime minister s official spokesman also rejected the claims saying: the attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his. but ex-foreign secretary robin cook says all the advice should now be published. he said the claims suggested parliament had only received a pr& of lord goldsmith s second opinion - and that it was actually drafted in no . this would be wrong even if lord goldsmith had signed the statement mr cook said because the attorney general s advice should be an independent legal opinion not subject to political negotiation of this kind .
1985,ban on hunting comes into force fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in england and wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight. the law faces a stiff test this weekend with the countryside alliance saying many hunts will be out in force. chief police officers spokesman nigel yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them. he said police would challenge the one of two isolated hunts which are threatening to break the law. but simon hart of the countryside alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations. the definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements. you can hunt a rat but not a mouse a rabbit but not a hare an artificial scent but not a real one he said. the attorney general lord goldsmith has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law. he said he will consult the director of public prosecutions and the police in the near future to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions. he has rejected a blanket policy of not enforcing the ban until the house of lords has considered its legality. john cooper a barrister and chairman of the league against cruel sports said the anti-hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices. he said police had acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences . the beaufort hunt had one pack out on thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend. under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to them. as well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent it will still be legal for the hunts to flush out foxes as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them. we are not going away. we will keep these hounds going we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again hunt master captain ian farquhar said. but tony banks labour mp for west ham said the issue would soon disappear and that people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about . he said had the government not prevaricated since in introducing the ban hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting. let the election decide this because the conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting he said.

318,uk bank seals south korean deal uk-based bank standard chartered said it would spend $. (£.) to buy one of south korea s main retail banks. standard chartered said acquiring korea first bank (kfb) fulfilled a strategic objective of building a bigger presence in asia s third largest economy. its shares fell nearly % in london as the bank raised funds for the deal by selling new stocks worth £ ($.) equal to % of its share capital. standard chartered expects about % of future group revenue to come from kfb. the south korean bank will also make up % of the group s total assets. the move a year after citigroup beat standard chartered to buy koram bank would be the south korean financial sector s biggest foreign takeover. this time around standard chartered is thought to have beaten hsbc to the deal. kfb is south korea s seventh largest bank with million retail customers % of the country s banking market and an extensive branch network. the country s banking market is three times the size of hong kong s with annual revenues of $. standard chartered has its headquarters in london but does two thirds of its business in asia and much of the rest in africa. we re comfortable with the price paid...the key here has been speed and decisiveness in making sure that we won said standard chartered chief executive mervyn davies at a london press conference. standard chartered said kfb was a well-managed conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce and represented a significant acquisition in a growth market . in london standard chartered s sale of million new shares to institutional investors pushed its share price down and contributing to the ftse s .% decline. standard chartered s shares were pence lower at by midday. some analysts also queried whether standard chartered had overpaid for kfb. the deal which requires regulatory approval is expected to be completed by april and to be earnings accretive in standard chartered said. rival banking giant hsbc which is based in london and hong kong was also in the running. standard chartered is believed to have gained the initiative by putting together a bid during the christmas break. they were able to move so quickly it caught hsbc by surprise the financial times newspaper quoted an insider in the talks as saying. hsbc will now have to wait for the next south korean bank in line to be sold off - thought likely to be korea exchange bank also currently in the hands of a us group. standard chartered said it was buying % of kfb an agreement that would bring an end to the bank s complex dual ownership. the south korean government owns .% of kfb while the remaining shareholding and operational control are in the hands of us private equity group newbridge capital. newbridge bought its stake during the government s nationalisation of several banks in the wake of the asia-wide currency crisis which crippled south korea s financial institutions. south korea s economy is expected to grow by .% this year. although often thought of an export-driven economy south korea s service sector has overtaken manufacturing in the last decade or so. services now make up roughly % of the economy and consumer spending and retail banking have become increasingly important. in the aftermath of the asian financial crisis the government encouraged the growth of consumer credit. bad loan problems followed; lg card the country s biggest credit card provider has been struggling to avoid bankruptcy for months for instance. but analysts believe south korea s financial services industry is still in its infancy offering plenty of scope for new products. standard chartered sees the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products . since kfb has been restructured from a wholesale bank into a retail bank focused on mortgage lending which makes up % of its loans.
851,japan s ageing workforce: built to last in his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. and the -year-old torao toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life. mr toshitsune is one of japan s centenarians - a club that is growing by % annually and where the oldest member is . at his neat osaka detached house where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony. between tasks this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: well what s most important for me is to be japan s number one. mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. and when it comes to longevity japan as a country appears to be doing just that. women can expect to live until men until four years longer than americans and europeans. on the outskirts of kyoto -year-old yuji shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends who are in their seventies. i think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved he remarks. on average we can live longer. whether it s the diet or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined or just something in the genes japan s elderly are remarkable. but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu his grandchildren have huge problems ahead. japan is the world s least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us. by japan s population is expected to peak at million then shrink to under million by the middle of the century. this means million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled. in the year if the birth rate remains the same people over will make up over % of the population explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo. so how will japan s finances stay on track after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending the public sector debt is already about % of the country s gross domestic product (gdp) the highest rate among industrialised countries. the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from the cost of running japan s welfare state will double to more than % of gdp while current account balances will deteriorate by over %. but unfortunately japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. glen wood vice president of deutsche securities japan asks; who s going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker who is going to build the economy who are going to be the leaders who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward one option is further welfare reform. another is immigration possibly from the philippines and indonesia. but so far any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff. standing next to tokyo harbour is a version of new york s statue of liberty. but as yet japan is not ready for an ellis island. japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think it s an option that s becoming more and more plausible and necessary insists mr wood. in japan as in europe which also faces a workforce decline immigration is a very sensitive subject. but for the japanese economy facing % fewer consumers by means slumping domestic sales of cars hi-tech kit and home appliances perhaps even another property crash. of course the japanese could always have more children. the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia. but there would be no pay back until when today s babies are taxpayers and the demographic crisis like in europe starts to unfold in . in contrast to japan - and of course the european union - the us population is expected to increase by % to million by the middle of the century. although president bush must re-devise social security to take account of a % rise in america s over the imf foresees a positive contribution to the us current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration. some voices in japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the japanese labour market. they want a shift towards financial services though doubts persist over the country s ability let alone willingness to move away from manufacturing. japan still has problems getting a viable banking system let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas says mr wood. japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency. come japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. there are fears that the world s number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. but none of this is mr toshitsune s concern anymore. at he chuckles that he feels fine.
1905,murphy: that was a bruising battle that s what i call a tough game. it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory. their organisation was very very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by. it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced. we knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the championship. it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early. we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually. it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it. i m not too bad but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on monday morning. in the backs we were not frustrated at such but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical. the different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult. but we managed to get the ball in our hands and i got a try near the end of the first half. it s always good to score. it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee. eddie (o sullivan) was very calm at half-time even though we were only - ahead. he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory. that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half. we were penalised a lot at the breakdown and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break. so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball. every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon. as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries but it does not that good. now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover. it s a big ask after such a bruising encounter. i was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday. it could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions. we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us. in the meantime when in rome ... .
1759,jarvis sells tube stake to spain shares in engineering group jarvis have soared more than % on news that it is offloading its stake in london underground consortium tube lines. the sale of the % stake to spain s ferrovial for £ ($) is a lifeline to jarvis which was weighed down by debts of more than £. the company recently warned it could go under if it did not secure a refinancing deal by mid-january . but now its banks have agreed to extend its credit facilities until march . the company also said it had agreed terms over the completion of of its biggest construction projects under the government s private finance initiative (pfi). jarvis wants to scale back the division which has proved too costly and has been blamed for many of its problems. instead it plans to focus on uk rail renewal roads and plant hire work. madrid-based ferrovial already holds a % stake in tube lines which maintains the jubilee northern and piccadilly lines. the spanish group has been keen to snap up more uk infrastructure assets having bought amey in . jarvis said the sale which raked in more than the £ analysts had expected would substantially enhance its financial position. i am now confident that we can now move forward in towards rebuilding jarvis and return it to growth as a profitable business said chief executive alan lovell. shares in jarvis were up more than % to pence by the close of trade on friday.
1370,markets fall on weak dollar fears rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on monday after a finance ministers meeting and stern words from fed chief alan greenspan. the london ftse fell .% while tokyo s nikkei dropped .% its steepest fall in three months. finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar whose slide could further jeopardise growth in japan and europe. and mr greenspan warned asian states could soon stop funding the us deficit. on monday afternoon the euro was close to an all-time high against the dollar at above $.. oil pushed higher too on monday as investors fretted about cold weather in the us and europe and a potential output cut from oil producers group opec although prices had cooled by the end of the day. in london the benchmark brent crude price closed down cents at $. a barrel while new york light sweet crude closed down cents at $. a barrel. the slide comes as the us has been attempting to talk up the traditional strong dollar policy. the latest to pitch in has been president george w bush himself who told the asia pacific economic co-operation (apec) summit in chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit. together with a $ trade gap the red ink spreading across america s public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower. and last week us treasury secretary john snow told an audience in the uk that the policy remained unaltered. but he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. some had looked to the meeting for direction. but mr snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda. for the us government letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix. us exports get more affordable helping perhaps to close the trade gap. in the meantime the debt keeps getting bigger with congress authorising an $ rise in what the us can owe - taking the total to $. trillion. but in a speech on friday federal reserve chairman alan greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. at present much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to asian states such as japan and china since the dollar is seen as the world s reserve currency. similarly asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the us as a whole spends and what it earns. but already they are turning more cautious - an auction of debt in august found few takers. and mr greenspan said that could turn into a trend if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments. it seems persuasive that given the size of the us current account deficit a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point he said.
142,apple mac mini gets warm welcome the mac mini has been welcomed by apple fans industry experts and pc users. the release of the tiny low-cost machine is seen as a good move for apple which currently has a small share of the desktop computer market. mac watchers and some analysts say the mac mini will go a long way to help apple appeal to the mass of consumers. they speculate that the mac mini will be bought by ipod owners and those wanting an easy-to-use and administer second home computer. it s the bravest move they have made yet said jonny evans news editor at macworld magazine. mr evans said the combination of low cost small size and huge numbers of ipod users could make it a big success. he thought that the machine would appeal to those that like apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware. it s deeply affordable he said. plus you know that you do not get viruses or all of the associated problems. already he said pc owning friends had declared that they would be buying one. interest in the new products launched at macworld expo was so strong that websites for apple s store and the show struggled to cope with demand. according to response statistics gathered by netcraft many visiting the apple store in the wake of mr jobs speech suffered lengthy response times. the macworld expo site was completely overwhelmed and went offline. i think fundamentally it s a good idea because it s cheap even for a pc said nick ross deputy labs editor at pc pro. apple s work on making things easy to use would also help the mac mini win fans he said. i think people expect it just to work now and really it should hesaid. the mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer he said. for browsing the web e-mail and all kinds of basic duties it s going to be absolutely adequate said mr ross. ian fogg broadband and personal technology analyst at jupiter research agreed that the mac mini could be very popular. apple has been hoping that sales of the ipod will have a halo effect on the sales of the mac he said. before now he said apple has been seen as a premium brand. but he said the mac mini changed that perception. it s a particularly good price when you see that it s apple that is doing it he said. apple expects the mac mini to sell for £ in the uk and $ in the us. adding extras such as a larger hard drive more memory and networking options will increase the basic price. it will go on sale from january. for consumers interested in style design and small size - which is what the majority of ipod customers are interested in - it s a natural next step said mr fogg. apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at said mr fogg who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction. his only misgivings were over how easy other consumers other than ipod owners would find using the machine. he said anyone wanting to use the mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor. they d be much more likely to pair a mac mini with a lcd or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost he said. those with flat screens and lcd monitors are likely to have bought them recently and not be in the market for a new machine. there are also questions over whether the mac mini will work with very old peripherals such as display keyboard and mouse. the mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music movies and images people accumulate said mr fogg. the mac mini is not quite ready for that yet he said. it does not have the right connectors that fit a tv screen or enough storage. said mr fogg: it s very much a computer. one dissenting opinion came from brian gammage vice-president of research at analysts gartner. he said: i don t think it changes the world. although the mac mini was very cheap for an apple computer it was still expensive compared to many pcs. also he said it appealed in categories that few consumers care about when buying a home computer. the pc world is a pile-em-high sell-em-cheap market he said and all of them are pretty interchangeable. since the days when apple ruled the personal computing world its market share has been on a long slow decline he said. every few years it does something to give its market share a kick then it starts to go back down again said mr gammage. the release of the mac mini fit perfectly with this trend he said.

1241,indonesians face fuel price rise indonesia s government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as %. millions of indonesians use kerosene for basic cooking and prices have been heavily subsidised for years. president susilo bambang yudhoyono s government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor. but critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help. millions of people were left homeless in indonesia aceh s region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late december. indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down. it spent . trillion rupiah ($.; £.) on fuel subsidies in a sum far in excess of its original projection of . trillion rupiah. since president yudhoyono s government came to power in october it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies. the (january to march) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices said sri mulyani indrawati state minister for national development planning. we are still considering if a % hike is suitable at the moment. the sooner the better for the state budget. the bbc s correspondent in jakarta rachel harvey told world business report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise. the big question is whether they go for one big short sharp shock and raise prices between % and % or whether they try to stagger it she said. indonesia s previous government led by president megawati sukarnoputri also attempted to cut subsidies in but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.

1131,ministers lose slopping out case the scottish executive has lost an appeal against an inmate s compensation for being forced to slop out in prison. armed robber robert napier won £ after he claimed he suffered an outbreak of the skin complaint eczema when slopping out at barlinnie prison. napier said that the practice where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets breached his human rights. on thursday the court of session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof. the executive faces more than similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates. more than actions have already been raised in the court of session and sheriff courts in scotland. an executive spokesman said: we will study this judgement in detail. much has changed to address the issues raised in the napier case for example slopping out has ended at barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated. today s judgement does not affect the outcome of other cases. napier a remand prisoner at the time raised a legal challenge in under the european convention on human rights in which he sought £ . he was awarded compensation last april after winning his case. executive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the european convention on human rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should be beyond reasonable doubt . this is the standard normally applied in criminal trials in scotland. however civil litigation is settled on the test of a balance of probabilities . judge lord cullen sitting with lord osborne and lord hamilton ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard. napier s lawyer tony kelly believes the action will soon be followed by others. mr kelly said: there are hundreds of people still undergoing slopping out overcrowding and poor regime and those people will certainly be heartened by today s judgement. scottish national party justice minister kenny macaskill said that the slopping out case had been a fiasco from start to finish . he said: ministers were fully aware of the state of scotland s jails. funds were available but they chose to ignore the problem and after this ruling i suspect we will be faced with even more claims and no doubt more payouts. a short term executive saving has resulted in a long term public cost.

466,healey targets england comeback leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sunday s return heineken cup clash with wasps as a further springboard to an england recall for the six nations. healey who won caps prior to the world cup has been in good form in the tigers resurgence this season. i definitely still have ambitions to play for england healey told the bbc. we will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) tests but when i look at the current squad i definitely feel there is a place there for me. healey who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career has reverted to the wing where he won most of his england caps. after recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september the -year-old is relishing his role in the tigers revival. i had six weeks out but fortunately i have resumed the sort of form i had before he said. i am basically playing where it best suits leicester. obviously i can play scrum-half fly-half or full-back at a moment s notice. but playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where i am not expected and influence things. that has been apparent in parts one and two of the wasps-leicester trilogy in recent weeks. first healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the tigers a - draw in their premiership meeting on november. then in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for martin corry to score the tigers third try. i caught cozza s eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score healey recalled. healey twice a heineken cup winner believes last sunday s match was up there with some of the biggest club contests he has played in. it was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game he recalled. there was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in. after about minutes i thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way. the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with a home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come. but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed rugby s version of rocky ii . there was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done he added. it was the first of a two-leg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result. i think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end i think we did. we have got to show the same desire again this week.
1072,windows worm travels with tetris users are being warned about a windows virus that poses as the hugely popular tetris game. the cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on pcs that it has infected. while users play the game the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks. the risk of infection by cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild. the cellery worm does not spread via e-mail like many other viruses. instead it browses computer networks for pcs that have not shut off all the insecure ways they connect to other machines. when it infects a machine cellery installs a version of tetris that users can play. as the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it. at the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines. the virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds. productivity may suffer too if users spend time playing tetris. pcs running windows me nt and xp could be vulnerable to the worm. if your company has a culture of allowing games to be played in the office your staff may believe this is simply a new game that has been installed - rather than something that should cause concern said graham cluley spokesman for anti-virus firm sophos. so far the number of people infected by cellery is thought to be very small and the risks of further infection is very low. sophos urged users and companies to update their anti-virus software to keep themselves protected.

709,sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. sun grid costs users $ () for an hour s worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. so-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed said sun s chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour he asked in a webcast launching sun s quarterly network computing event in california. the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil gas and financial services industries. some of them want to book computing capacity of more than processors each sun said. mr schwartz ran a demonstration of the service showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. hundreds of servers were used simultaneously working on the problem for a few seconds each. although it only took a few seconds the experiment cost $ (£.) because it had used up hours worth of computing power. the sun grid relies on solaris the operating system owned by sun. initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by sun.

1915,no seasonal lift for house market a swathe of figures have provided further evidence of a slowdown in the uk property market. the council of mortgage lenders (cml) british bankers association (bba) and building societies association (bsa) all said mortgage lending was slowing. cml figures showed gross lending fell by % in november as the number of people buying new homes fell. elsewhere the bba added underlying mortgage lending rose by £ in november compared to october s £.. the cml said that loans for new property purchases fell % year-on-year to - the lowest total seen since february . data from the cml showed lending fell to just over £ in november from £. a year earlier. separate figures from the building societies association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood % lower than at the same time last year at a seasonally-adjusted £.. the figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a winter sale and slash prices by up to %. miles shipside commercial director at rightmove said sellers would have to be more realistic with their asking prices to tempt buyers. the average asking price of a home fell by more than £ from £ in november to £ in december while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to days from in the summer. rightmove said estate agents were set to enter with a third more properties on their books than a year ago. even once the quieter holiday period is over sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market. in any business excess supply and low demand means one thing - cut prices mr shipside said. the proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling even in the current market. overall asking prices have fallen .% from their july peaks as the equivalent of £ has been cut from an average property. a host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in . what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over as a whole cml director general michael coogan said. it s a fairly consistent picture showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market investec economist philip shaw said. however the figures do suggest only a modest weakening and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time though a collapse is still unlikely.
1934,consumer concern over rfid tags consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency id (rfid) tags in shops a survey says. more than half of people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low. the survey of consumers in the uk france germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini. the firm works on behalf of more than firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology. the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number. more than half (%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. ard jan vetham capgemini s principal consultant on rfid said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology. acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers the industry can reach this point. he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. they are also in use as a passcard for the toll in the midlands in the uk. mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed (%) believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance. he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. at least once consumer group - consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering (caspian) - has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. all kinds of personal belongings including clothes could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners it warned.
208,public show for reynolds portrait sir joshua reynolds portrait of omai will get a public airing following fears it would stay hidden because of an export wrangle. the tate gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the uk. the century painting has remained in storage but the owner has agreed to allow it to be part of an exhibition. the exhibition of reynolds work will be shown at tate britain from may. joshua reynolds: the creation of celebrity will feature prints caricatures and sculpture by the century artist who painted some of the most famous personalities of his day. portrait of omai fetched the second highest amount for a british painting when it was sold at auction for £. in . it was bought by a london dealer who sold it on to a collector. the unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance. in march the tate managed to raise £. funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since. the portrait is of a young man who was dubbed the noble savage when he arrived in london from polynesia. he became a darling of london society and was invited to all the best parties by people who were fascinated by such an exotic character. sir joshua painted him after his arrival in and it became the artist s most famous work after it was first exhibited at the royal academy in .

175,chinese exports rise % in exports from china leapt during over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth. the spurt put china s trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. it may also increase pressure on china to relax the peg joining its currency the yuan with the weakening dollar. the figures released by the ministry of commerce come as china s tax chief confirmed that growth had topped % in for the second year in a row. state administration of taxation head xie xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a .% rise in tax revenues to . trillion yuan ($; £). according to the ministry of commerce china s exports totalled $. in december taking the annual total up .% to $.. with imports rising a similar amount the deficit rose to $.. the increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling yuan in according to mr xie. china s exporting success has made the trade deficit of the united states soar even further and made trade with china a sensitive political issue in washington. the peg keeping the yuan around . to the dollar is often blamed by us lawmakers for job losses at home. a us report issued on tuesday on behalf of a congressionally-mandated panel said almost . million posts disappeared between and . the pace accelerated in the final three years of the period said the report for the us-china economic and security review commission moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors. the us s overall trade deficit with china was $ in and is expected to rise to about $ for .
319,business fears over sluggish eu economy as european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business. lille is a popular tourist destination for britons who want a taste of france at the weekend. but how many tourists look at the impressively grand victorian chambre de commerce which stands beside the opera house and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern english towns - on the wealth created by coal steel and textiles like northern england and industrial scotland those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in . beck-crespel is a specialist steel firm in armentieres about miles from lille. the company has not laid off a worker since . it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry but not many of those are being built in europe these days. director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply while his key markets are now in china and india. in our business the market is absolutely global you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged european union (if we did that) we would need not people but perhaps just or he says. it isn t just globalisation that is hurting; the law in france means workers are paid for a hour week even though they work just hours. but at least there is still a steel industry. coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. new business has been attracted but not enough to make up the difference. that is one reason why people here are not great fans of the eu says frederic sawicki a politics lecturer at the university of lille. in the region today the unemployment rate is % in some areas it is %. they don t see what europe is doing for them so there is a kind of euro scepticism especially in the working classes he says. which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here. the euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. much of that trade passes through the world s largest port rotterdam in holland home to specialist crane maker huisman itrec. its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken russian submarine kursk from the sea bed but huisman itrec is now setting up a factory in china where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer. boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home. in the us growth is something like % in china they are estimating % and in the eu it is more or less % he says. mr addink blames the euro for stifling demand. he much preferred the old currencies of europe which moved in relation to each country s economic performance. in germany industry is exporting more these days but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. growth is likely to peak this year at just under %. in britain that would be a bad year; in germany it is one of the best in recent years. with germany making up a third of the eurozone s economy this is a major problem. if germany doesn t once again become the powerhouse of europe growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. however at one factory near the dutch border things are changing. the siemens plant at boscholt makes cordless phones and employs staff. staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay after siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to hungary. factory manager herbert stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity by nearly % . but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china. the government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers says helmut schneider director of the institute for the study of labour at bonn university. labour is too costly in germany especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. if we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half he says. the eu set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by . four years into that process and the target seems further away than ever.
1441,mobile games come of age the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. a brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below. part two will follow on monday. reviews of call of duty splinter cell - pandora tomorrow lord of the rings and pocket kingdom will follow on monday if you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. even before nokia s n-gage game phone launched in late many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset. and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market. that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders lunar lander and bejewelled. there are also versions of titles such as colin mcrae rally that you typically find on pcs and consoles. there are shoot-em-ups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost £. what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push. by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use graphics. the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them. a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth short-range radio technology. with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing. too fast too furious (digital bridges) as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games - because i m rubbish at them. no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. winning gives you cash for upgrades. graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play. fatal force (macrospace) a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth. graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. both background music and sounds effects work well. the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders. weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. with the right power-up you can go into a matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range. online the game has quite a following with clans player rankings and even new downloadable maps.
512,digital guru floats sub-$ pc nicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mit s media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than $ (£). he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood . he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linux-based operating system we have to get the display down to below $ to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. the second trick is to get rid of the fat if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory. the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on. while the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. we put in laptops three years ago only one has been broken the kids cherish these things it s also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook. mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. nokia make million cell phones a year so for us to claim we re going to make million laptops is a big number but we re not talking about doing it in three or five years we re talking about months. he plans to be distributing them by the end of and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. in china they spend $ per child per year on textbooks. that s for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.
2222,rem announce new glasgow concert us band rem have announced plans to perform for scottish fans in a rescheduled gig. the band will play in what has been dubbed europe s biggest tent on glasgow green on tuesday june. they were forced to pull out of a concert at the secc in glasgow last month after bassist mike mills contracted flu. fans who bought tickets for the original february show can attend the rescheduled concert. the june gig will act as a warm-up for rem s open air concert at balloch castle country park on the banks of loch lomond four days later. promoters regular music booked glasgow green as the secc was not available on the most suitable date. mark mackie director of regular music said: it is fantastic news and it really shows rem s commitment to their scottish fans that they are coming back to glasgow for what will be a truly unique gig. the rem gigs will kick-start what promises to be a memorable summer for scottish music lovers. grammy award winners will play hampden on june while oasis will also perform at the national stadium in glasgow on june. coldplay have announced a concert at bellahouston park in glasgow on july and t in the park will be held at balado near kinross from - july. ticketweb and the secc box office will write to customers who bought tickets for the february gig asking if they want to attend the new show. those who bought tickets in person are being urged to return to the point of purchase. anyone who cannot make the concert will be given a refund. the cut-off date for swapping tickets is april when those remaining will go on sale to the public.
2060,wenger dejected as arsenal slump arsenal manager arsene wenger claimed their display in the - defeat against bayern munich was our worst peformance in the champions league . kolo toure s late goal gives the gunners hope for the second leg but wenger said: the only positive is that we are still in the tie. the players are really down in the dressing-room. i feel we really turned in a bad performance. at - we faced a real struggle but - at least gives us a chance. goalscorer toure was also at fault for two goals and wenger said: we need to help toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment. wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself adding: but there is enough time for crying. i could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on. in this job you have good and bad nights. this was a bad night - but i still have confidence in the quality of my players as well as their spirit and desire. but wenger s bayern counterpart felix magath was in no mood to celebrate either. he said: i am far from happy despite the win. my players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal. arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf. arsenal keeper jens lehmann whose personal rivalry with bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn was not helped by the result said: do i blame myself for the third goal as a goalkeeper i always blame myself. i just know the goals were very easy against us. in my time here we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens. it would have been impossible to go through at - - but with the goal we have chances. everything is now possible.
194,gizmondo gadget hits the shelves the gizmondo combined media player phone and gaming gadget goes on sale on saturday. priced at £ the handheld device is debuting in the uk and goes on sale in the us and mainland europe in the next few weeks. a catalogue of about games is being prepared for the gadget including the great escape and conflict vietnam. the british-backed gadget faces stiff competition from handheld gaming devices made by nintendo and sony. the gizmondo device packs a lot of functions inside its black cover and is aimed at gamers and those that want more from their game-playing gadgets. it can be used to play games music tracks and movies. it can take and store digital photos and be used like a mobile phone to send text multimedia and e-mail messages. the phone service to enable people to send messages is being provided by pre-pay vodafone accounts bundled in with the device. it also works with gps (global position system) so can also be used as a navigation aid or to support a variety of location-based services. the gprs and bluetooth wireless data systems onboard mean that it can be used for multi-player gaming. the gadget will be available from the gizmondo store on london s regent street and from several other retail partners. although the device rolls together an impressive list of functions it will face serious competition from three established names in mobile gaming: nintendo nokia and sony. the main competition is likely to come from nintendo and sony. nintendo s ds handheld went on sale on march and priced at £ costs far less than the gizmondo. it also has a ready pool of fans of earlier nintendo handhelds to draw on. in the first two days it was on sale in europe the ds handhelds were sold - a better debut than the gamecube enjoyed. sony s psp was due to make its european debut in march but now this is likely to be delayed by a few months. the psp is due to go on sale in the us later this month and a bundle including the player accessories and a copy of spiderman is expected to cost about $ (£). the psp can also play music and movies and supports wireless multiplayer gaming. nokia s n-gage could also be a competitor on the telecommunications side. this too crams a fully functional phone into a gadget that also plays games.
649,mobile networks seek turbo boost third-generation mobile () networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services. that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the world congress in cannes last week. fast networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the global mobile suppliers association. at siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to times faster than current networks. the system is not available commercially yet but motorola the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access) a high-speed high bandwidth technology available now. early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second (mbps) compared with less than kilobits per second (kbps) on standard networks. high-speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) - sometimes called super - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to a report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys. a number of companies are developing the technology. nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access. the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers. while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks said dr alastair brydon author of the analysys report: pushing beyond the limits of with hsdpa and other enhancements. the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic wcdma [] he added. motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of . have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor cell using a single hsdpa device. but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution data optimised (ev-do). us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its network at the end of last year. we are expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprint s vice president for technology development when the contract was announced. as part of $ in multi-year contracts announced late last year sprint will spend around $ on ev-do technology from lucent technologies nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of .-. megabits a second and peak download rates of .. the uk-based operator with services in the uk ireland and germany has opted for technology based on the high speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) standard. using technology from lucent it will offer data speeds of . from next summer on its isle of man network and will eventually support speeds of up to .. us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson. siemens plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but christoph caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of . siemens - in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one. this enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. the speeds offered mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for licences. but today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dial-up phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of . megabits a second - must faster than . this means users are likely to find disappointing unless the networks are souped up. if they aren t those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. a commercial system could be as far away as though siemens did not rule out an earlier date.

1709,assembly ballot papers missing hundreds of ballot papers for the regional assembly referendum in the north east have disappeared . royal mail says it is investigating the situation which has meant about homes in county durham are not receiving voting packs. officials at darlington council are now in a race against time to try and rectify the situation. the all-postal votes of about two million electors are due to be handed in by november. a spokesman for darlington council said: we have sent out the ballot papers the problem is with royal mail. somewhere along the line something has gone wrong and these ballot papers have not been delivered. the royal mail is investigating to see if they can find out what the problem is. a spokeswoman for royal mail said: we are investigating a problem with the delivery route in the mowden area of darlington. this is affecting several hundred properties which have failed to receive ballot papers. we are working closely with the council and will do all we can to help rectify the problem. no-one will not receive their ballot paper as special hand deliveries will take place where necessary. we are unaware of any other problems of this kind to do with the regional assembly vote. the darlington council spokesman added: initially we had complaints from a couple of residents in mowden to say they thought they should have had their ballot papers by now. we then made further investigations and it became clear this was a bigger issue. a spokeswoman for the electoral commission told bbc news online that letters were being sent out to those homes affected. she said the commission was satisfied that measures had been put in place to ensure all voters received ballot papers in time. so far a total of ballot envelopes have been scanned by bar code at counting offices across the north east.
2215,junk e-mails on relentless rise spam traffic is up by % putting the total amount of e-mail that is junk up to an astonishing %. the figures from e-mail management firm email systems will alarm firms attempting to cope with the amount of spam in their in-boxes. while virus traffic has slowed down denial of service attacks are on the increase according to the firm. virus mail accounts for just over % of all e-mail traffic analysis by the firm has found. it is no longer just multi-nationals that are in danger of so-called denial of service attacks in which websites are bombarded by requests for information and rendered inaccessible. email systems refers to a small uk-based engineering firm which received a staggering million e-mails in january. the type of spam currently being sent has subtlety altered in the last few months according to email systems analysis. half of spam received since christmas has been health-related with gambling and porn also on the increase. scam mails offering ways to make a quick buck have declined by %. january is clearly a month when consumers are less motivated to purchase financial products or put money into dubious financial opportunities said neil hammerton managing director of email systems. spammers seem to have adapted their output to reflect this focussing instead on medically motivated and pornographic offers presumably intentionally intended to coincide with what is traditionally considered to be the bleakest month in the calendar he said.
440,lasers help bridge network gaps an indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country. tata teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers offices and its own core network. the laser bridges work across distances up to and can be set up much faster than cable connections. in months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than locations. in this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task said mr r. sridharan vice president of networks at tata. heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult he said. in some locations he said permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. he said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. this has led chennai-based tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between tata s core network and the premises of customers. the lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network. the hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses. the laser bridges can route data at speeds up to . ( times faster than a broadband connection) but tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of -. the lasers are also ideal for india because of its climate. it s particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it s hardly ever foggy he said. in places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds. the laser links also take far less time to set up and get working said mr sridharan. once we get the other permissions normal time period for set up is a few hours he said. by contrast he said digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months. this speed of set up has helped tata with its aggressive expansion plans. just over months ago the firm had customers in only about towns and cities. but by the end of march the firm hopes to reach more than . speed is very important because of the pace of competition said mr sridharan.
563,saab to build cadillacs in sweden general motors the world s largest car maker has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized cadillac bls at its loss-making saab factory in sweden. the car unveiled at the geneva motor show is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. it will not be sold in the us said gm europe president carl-peter forster. as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine. gm s announcement should go some way to allay fears of the saab factory s closure. the factory in trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about gm s planned severe cutbacks in its troubled european operations. but the group s new commitment to the swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group s opel workers in ruesselsheim germany. they may now have to face a larger proportion of gm s cuts. neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden since it reflects saab s failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market. for years saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with bmw mercedes and jaguar. the segment s leaders do not agree. gm s plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers. in the us it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. yet it could prove tough for cadillac to steal market share from the majors in europe. other luxury car makers most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe. there german marques mercedes benz and bmw have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market. bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the saab factory which currently produces fewer than cars per year. that is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations and saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in to $ (£; euros) from $ the previous year. beyond the job cuts announced last year at its european operations gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs opels - badged as vauxhalls in the uk - and now cadillacs on the same framework and by allowing the different brands to share parts. another way to further reduce saab s losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car. doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers. but not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news. the current trend towards us production was stupid he said. in a separate announcement gm unveiled a new scheme to allow european consumers the chance to test drive its opel and vauxhall models. it is to deploy a fleet of test cars across countries inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for -hours. it follows a similar initiative by gm in the us. gm said it wanted to change customers perceptions about opel and vauxhall cars showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.
1399,european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects. it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around. the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton s win in the hurdles. running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. but what was great about sunday s performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah. and knowing that she got the better of diane in a head-to-head race will give sarah confidence. in the men s race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. in fact the men s hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid. phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of . which puts him at the top of the world rankings. i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then phillips always has. a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance. he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and hurdles and you can t ask for more than that. kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we ve seen so far. she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. it wasn t all good news in sheffield. i thought both the races were disappointing in different ways. jason gardener may have won but he wasn t at his best. i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him. he s there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. in the women s race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka. the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection. if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker. janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn t be the case. the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her. a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf. findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain. yusuf who came third in the is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship. he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent. so we shall have to see what happens to both of them.
378,parents face video game lessons ways of ensuring that parents know which video games are suitable for children are to be considered by the games industry. the issue was discussed at a meeting between uk government officials industry representatives and the british board of film classification. it follows concerns that children may be playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. in britons spent £ on games more than ever before. and this christmas parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles. violent games have been hit by controversy after the game manhunt was blamed by the parents of -year-old stefan pakeerah who was stabbed to death in leicester in february. his mother giselle said her son s killer warren leblanc - who was jailed for life in september - had mimicked behaviour in the game. police investigating stefan s murder dismissed its influence and said manhunt was not part of its legal case. the issue of warnings on games for adults was raised on sunday by trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt. this was the focus of the talks between government officials representatives from the games industry and the british board of film classification. adults can make informed choices about what games to play. children can t and they deserve to be protected said culture secretary tessa jowell after the meeting. industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn t play. roger bennett director general of entertainment and leisure software publishers association said: a number of initiatives were discussed at the meeting. they will be formulated to create specific proposals to promote greater understanding recognition and awareness of the games rating system ensuring that young people are not exposed to inappropriate content. among the possible measures could be a campaign to explain to parents that many games are made for an adult audience as well as changes to the labelling of the games themselves. according to industry statistics a majority of players are over with the average age of a gamer being . academics point out that there has not been any definitive research linking bloodthirsty games such as manhunt with violent responses in players. in a report published this week for the video standards council dr guy cumberbatch said: the research evidence on media violence causing harm to viewers is wildly exaggerated and does not stand up to scrutiny. dr cumberbatch head of the social policy think tank the communications research group reviewed the studies on the issue. he concluded that there was an absence of convincing research that media violence caused harm.
739,labour s election love-in peace and love have been in short supply in the labour party in recent days. if press reports are to be believed alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each other s throats over the contents of labour s next election manifesto. but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning as they joined john prescott to unveil labour s latest poster campaign. the event - at old billingsgate fish market on the banks of the thames - was a carefully choreographed show of unity. and the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months. it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years. the first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when - in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions - labour s speakers crackled to life with the sound of booker t and the mgs. then a vw camper van trundled into view decked out in that most mind-bending of psychedelic messages - lowest mortgage rate for years . as the side-door slid open it looked for one glorious moment as if the cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together scooby doo-style. but sadly it wasn t the cabinet who had raided the dressing-up box - just six rather ill-at-ease looking labour students. two were dressed as regency dandies - to unveil a poster trumpeting the longest period of economic growth for years . another pair of students were in a beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the lowest interest rates since the . the remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the lowest unemployment since the seventies . the politicians - led out by john prescott - were soberly-suited as always. the event may have been designed to highlight labour s economic success under mr brown but there was little doubt who was in charge. the chancellor walked side-by-side with mr milburn pointedly exchanging chit chat as they approached the microphone. but it was mr milburn who took centre stage speaking of the positive campaign the party hoped to stage in the coming weeks and months . the mobile poster vans would let people know britain is working again . mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labour s shared purpose and united dedication . it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor s record and in a final flourish to produce his famous pledge card from claiming labour has met all of its promises. the event was carefully stage-managed to underline cabinet unity. and more specifically to demonstrate the central role mr brown will play in the election campaign despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn. but keen students of body language will have had a field day. there was much forced smiling for the cameras but only mr prescott who revels in such occasions seemed to be truly enjoying himself. mr milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor as he spoke nodding thoughtfully. but it was the former health secretary s final gesture placing an arm on mr brown s back as they walked away from the microphones which was perhaps the most telling. thanks for dropping by gordon he might have been saying.
1806,clarke to unveil immigration plan new controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols will be part of government plans unveiled on monday. home secretary charles clarke wants to introduce a points system for economic migrants and increase deportations of failed asylum seekers. tony blair has said people are right to be concerned about abuses of the system but there is no magic bullet . the tories say labour is acting too late while the lib dems say the plans may not produce an efficient system. the government s new five-year plan is designed to show how labour would reform immigration and asylum controls if it wins the election expected to be held in may. ministers deny they have been spurred into action by tory campaigning or because the prime minister is worried too little has been done. instead they say the plans are part of an evolving process aimed at winning public confidence. mr clarke is expected to announce an end to the automatic right to settle for immigrants families and the introduction of fingerprinting for all visa applicants. the prime minister on sunday said immigration would be toughened up to ensure only those immigrants with skills the uk really needs will be granted work permits. but he rejected the tories call for a quota on economic migrants saying no arbitrary figure could reflect the uk s needs. mr blair told bbc radio s westminster hour: we should cut the number or increase it depending on the country s needs... the public are worried about this they are worried rightly because there are abuses of the immigration and asylum system. but he defended the uk s current regime saying all systems around the world were subject to abuse. tory proposals to cap the number of asylum seekers and process all claims abroad would not work argued mr blair. he said: we will not be... pretending there is some simple easy way of processing britain s asylum seekers in some other country because no such other country exists. conservative shadow home secretary david davis said the government had failed to remove failed asylum seekers from the uk and limits on economic migrants had been a shambles . what we are seeing today is a rather panicky response from the government after eight years of failure he said. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said labour was right to reject the tories idea of quotas on asylum. but he said it was yet to be seen if mr clarke could deliver a fair and efficient asylum system .
1529,terror detainees win lords appeal detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws the uk s highest court has ruled. in a blow to the government s anti-terror measures the house of lords law lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by nine detainees. most of the men are being indefinitely held in belmarsh prison south london. the law lords said the measures were incompatible with european human rights laws. the men will stay behind bars while ministers decide how to react. the ruling creates a major problem for charles clarke on his first day as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation. the liberal democrats say mr clarke should use the fact he is new to the job to take issue with a law established by his predecessor david blunkett. belmarsh prison has been dubbed britain s guantanamo bay by civil rights campaigners opposed to the use of emergency anti-terror laws. the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. however those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. on thursday senior law lord lord bingham said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status . lord nicholls of birkenhead in his ruling said: indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law. it deprives the detained person of the protection a criminal trial is intended to afford. he said the weakness for the government s case was that it was trying to justify detention without trial for foreign suspects - but not for british suspects. lord hoffmann said: the real threat to the life of the nation in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these. but lord walker of gestingthorpe the one law lord to oppose the appeal said the anti-terror laws contained important safeguards against oppression. in a statement detainee a in woodhill prison said: i hope now that the government will act upon this decision scrap this illegal law and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones. the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. ben emmerson qc representing seven of the detainees said the men had already been in custody for nearly three years. he said they had been given no idea when if ever they would be released had never been formally interviewed and there was no prospect they would ever be put on trial. when the men were first held they took their cases to the special immigration appeals commission (siac). the commission ruled on july that the anti-terror act unjustifiably discriminated against foreign nationals as british people could not be held in the same way. but that ruling was later overturned by the court of appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation.
1502,iran budget seeks state sell-offs iran s president mohammad khatami has unveiled a budget designed to expand public spending by % but loosen the islamic republic s dependence on oil. the budget for the fiscal year starting on march calls for the sell-off of % of the state s corporate holdings. mr khatami s second term as president ends on august making this his last budget. but opposition from members of parliament who have attacked previous privatisations could block his plans. elections in may ousted many of mr khatami s supporters in parliament in favour of more hard-line religious conservatives. late last year they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment. the ruling was a response to the involvement in telecoms and airport projects by turkish companies which hardliners accused of doing business with israel. it came not long after the expediency council - iran s ultimate decision-maker - blessed mr khatami s policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy transport telecoms and banking. continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans but also of mr khatami s hope of modestly reducing the government s reliance on oil revenues. in an address to the majlis mr khatami predicted economic growth of .% in - up from .% in the current year. he said he wanted to increase the - budget to trillion rials ($.; £.) from the previous year s trillion. within that figure taxation would rise to $. a rise of over % from what is expected from the current year. in contrast oil revenues were expected to fall to $. from $ in the year to march . current government expenditure should come from tax revenues mr khatami said. oil revenues should be used for productive investment. mr khatami has already been blocked by parliament from reducing the subsidies on many products including bread and petrol reducing his room to manoeuvre.

417,firms pump billions into pensions employers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary pensions over the past year research suggests. a survey of schemes by incomes data services (ids) said employer contributions had increased from £. to £. a year a rise of .%. companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by % or more ids said. many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open because of rising costs and increased liabilities. a final salary scheme also known as a defined benefit scheme promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire. the rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase or defined contribution schemes. these are less risky for employers. under money purchase schemes employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on retirement. ids said there were some schemes in good health. but in many cases firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle yawning deficits . the level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late . in / for example contributions rose by .% and in / by .%. in contrast between and some employers cut their contribution levels. helen sudell editor of the ids pensions service said the rise in contributions was staggering and the highest ever recorded by ids. we have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision said ms sudell. with figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes.
1215,wru proposes season overhaul the welsh rugby union wants to restructure the northern hemisphere season into four separate blocks. the season would start with the celtic league in october followed by the heineken cup in february and march and the six nations moved to april and may. after a nine week break the wru then proposes a two-month period of away and home international matches. wru chairman david pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country. he added: we feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation. equally we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure. moving the six nations from its traditional february beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing pickering argued. the plan will be put before the international rugby board next month where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed. pickering added: it s very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it - not least the revenue from the broadcasters which is extremely important. we ve got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits.
1594,blair ready to call election tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on may. the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll it has not shifted. over the weeks there have been any number of signs that was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term. and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour s stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust. and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster - to underline that economic message. and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties tax and spend policies. during the phoney campaign labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning £ bn cuts in public services. the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labour s plans was a cut. and it looked like the labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger cuts . he was sacked for his gaffe but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track. a second central argument will be over taxation with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again. mr brown slaps that aside claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. as usual the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum the war on iraq law and order and education for example. but as ever it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. and whatever that outcome is set to be a far more lively even bitter campaign than s non-event.

612,profile: gordon brown the ultimate prize of downing street may continue to elude him but as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times. he reached that milestone last june when he overtook david lloyd george who served for seven years and days between and . how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: those who fail and those who get out in time. ) there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election. but for now mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him. gordon brown was born in glasgow on february the son of a church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy. at he was canvassing for labour and by his he was a leading political activist in scotland. he achieved a first class degree in history from edinburgh university where he went on to complete a phd. his early career was spent lecturing working in television and making a name for himself in the scottish labour party. his first attempt to enter westminster for edinburgh south in was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs michael ancram. but in he took dunfermline east a new constituency including rosyth naval base pit villages and coastal towns. entering westminster he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield tony blair. within four years mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury. he became shadow chancellor under john smith s leadership in . after the death of leader john smith in he stood aside agreeing to give tony blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington. the other part of the deal that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor is the stuff of westminster legend. mr blair s supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns - and even a television film - have been devoted to the alleged deal. but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in mr brown continued his devotion to politics. during the election campaign he is said to have worked an average of hours a day six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning. this dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by mr brown s former girlfriend of five years princess marguerite of romania the eldest daughter of ex-king michael of romania who said a relationship with him was politics politics politics . if that was true then mr brown who married pr executive sarah macaulay in changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in . their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary days after being born seven weeks prematurely. a year later in october the couple had a son - john - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. a trip to africa earlier this year to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side. the ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest. the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more old labour than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project. yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing street neighbour over the succession. mr blair for his part is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute. after a recent run of negative headlines labour mps took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering for the good of the party. events like this and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues make it impossible to dismiss the brown/blair feud as just journalistic hearsay cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster. how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question. a truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign. but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown - using the budget as a springboard - is to revitalise labour s campaign. amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader. there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including mr milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that mr brown can. and mr blair s decision to name his own retirement date has at least given mr brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister s intention to serve a full third term if elected took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.
1619,mci shares climb on takeover bid shares in us phone company mci have risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks. the wall street journal reported on thursday that qwest has bid $. (£.) for mci. other firms have also expressed an interest in mci the second-largest us long-distance phone firm and may now table rival bids analysts said. shares in mci which changed its name from worldcom when it emerged from bankruptcy were up .% at $.. press reports suggest that qwest and mci may reach an agreement as early as next week although rival bids may muddy the waters. the largest us telephone company verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with mci reuters quoted sources as saying. consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. a merger between mci and qwest would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october. last week sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about $. competition has intensified and fixed-line phone providers such as mci and at&t have seen themselves overtaken by rivals. buying mci would give qwest a local phone service provider access to mci s global network and business-based subscribers. mci also offers internet services. mci was renamed after it emerged from chapter bankruptcy protection in april last year. it hit the headlines as worldcom in after admitting it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. the scandal was a key factor in a global slide in share prices and the reverberations are still being felt today. shareholders lost about $ when the company collapsed while workers lost their jobs. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial accused of overseeing an $ fraud.

183,xbox power cable fire fear microsoft has said it will replace more than million power cables for its xbox consoles due to safety concerns. the company said the move was a preventative step after reports of fire hazard problems with the cables. it affects xboxes made before october for all regions but mainland europe - and consoles in that region made before january . microsoft said it had received reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables. the firm said fewer than one in consoles had experienced component failures. the recall affects almost three quarters of all xboxes sold around the world since its launch in . in a statement it added: in almost all instances any damage caused by these failures was contained within the console itself or limited to the tip of the power cord at the back of the console. but in seven cases customers reported sustaining a minor burn to their hand. in cases customers reported smoke damage or minor damage to a carpet or entertainment centre. this is a preventative step we re choosing to take despite the rarity of these incidents said robbie bach senior vice president microsoft home and entertainment division. we regret the inconvenience but believe offering consumers a free replacement cord is the responsible thing to do. consumers can order a new cable from the xbox website or by telephoning in the uk. microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order. it advised users to turn off their xboxes when not in use. a follow-up to xbox is expected to released at the end of this year or the beginning of .

1774,warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. however dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. the link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. the message s subject line reads urgent tsunami earthquake appeal and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts. the web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. patricia sanders spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down. she said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered. it is thought that the fake site is being run from romania. ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web. dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. bt and dec s hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down she said. ms sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not dec s style and that it would never canvass support in this way. she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed. none of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records. this is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid. one e-mail sent out in early january came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the netherlands. the con was very similar to the familiar nigerian forward fee fraud e-mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile. other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information. in a monthly report anti-virus firm sophos said that two e-mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top hoax list during january. another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of microsoft s outlook e-mail program. anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to.
604,da vinci code is lousy history the plot of an international bestseller that thousands of readers are likely to receive as a christmas present is laughable a clergyman has said. the da vinci code claims jesus was not crucified but married mary magdalene and died a normal death. it claims this was later covered up by the church. the bishop of durham the rt rev dr tom wright described the novel as a great thriller but lousy history . the book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. despite enjoying dan brown s conspiracy theory the bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims. writing his christmas message in the northern echo the bishop said: conspiracy theories are always fun - fun to invent fun to read fun to fantasise about. dan brown is the best writer i ve come across in the genre but anyone who knows anything about century history will see that this underlying material is laughable. a great deal of credible evidence proves the biblical version of jesus life was true according to the bishop. the evidence for jesus and the origins of christianity is astonishingly good he said. we have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the new testament than we have for the main classical authors like cicero virgil and tacitus. historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of jesus with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived and don t fit the world of later legend. brown s book has become a publishing phenomenon consistently topping book charts in the uk and us. the da vinci code has been translated into languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications including guides on to how to read the book rebuttals and counter claims. the book which has become an international best-seller in little over two years is set to be made into a film starring tom hanks.

493,brown outlines third term vision gordon brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of new labour s next general election bid. he said ensuring every child in britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the nhs s creation. the chancellor has previously planned the party s election strategy but this time the role will be filled by alan milburn - a key ally of tony blair. the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labour s campaign and praised his handling of the economy. writing in the guardian newspaper mr brown outlined his view of the direction new labour should be taking. as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear labour s ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education good health and sustainable communities. bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr brown s article was a warning shot to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. it was as always coded and careful... but entirely deliberate was mr marr s assessment. the prime minister was asked about mr brown s article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio s today programme. mr blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor s role would be central . mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was in part because of mr brown s management of the economy. and he pledged childcare would be a centrepiece of labour s manifesto. he also predicted the next general election will be a tough tough fight for new labour. but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about may. mr blair said he was taking nothing for granted ahead of the vote - warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour s majority instead of hoping for an outright win.

635,more power to the people says hp the digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories according to carly fiorina chief of technology giant hewlett packard. the job of firms such as hp now she said in a speech at the consumer electronics show (ces) was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. she said the goal for was to make people the centre of technology. ces showcases new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in . the tech-fest the largest of its kind in the world runs from to january. the digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible she told delegates. revolution has always been about giving power to the people. she added: the real story of the digital revolution is not just new products but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell. part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content such as images video and music. crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device such as a digital camera to others such as portable media players. a lot of work still needs to be done however to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly she said. ms fiorina s talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle fashion and personalisation something she sees as key to what people want. special guest singer gwen stefani joined her on-stage to promote her own range of hp digital cameras which ms stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by japanese youth culture. the digital cameras which are due to go on sale in the us by the summer are based on the hp model. the emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year s ces with tiny wearable players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. ms fiorina also announced that hp was working with nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles which would launch in europe early this year. the service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content like a track s ringtone simultaneously. the service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive. among the other new products she showcased was the digital media hub a big upgrade to hp s digital entertainment centre. coming out in the autumn in the us the box is a networked high-definition tv cable set-top box digital video recorder and dvd recorder. it has a removable hard drive cartridge memory card slots and light scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised dvd labels and covers. it is designed to contain all a household s digital media such as pre-recorded tv shows pictures videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. the hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the pc so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. research suggests that about million images are saved and shared every day equating to billion a year. eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. ms fiorina was one of several keynote speakers who also included microsoft chief bill gates to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next months. in a separate announcement during the keynote speech ms fiorina said that hp would be partnering mtv to replace this year s mtv asia music award. mtv s asia aid will be held in bangkok on february and is aimed at helping to raise money for the asian tsunami disaster.
691,economy focus for election battle britain s economic future will be at the heart of labour s poll campaign chancellor gordon brown has said. he was speaking after cabinet members held their last meeting at no before the expected election announcement. he said voters would recognise that labour had brought stability and growth and would continue to do so. meanwhile the tories outlined their plans to tackle yob culture and the lib dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax. earlier the archbishop of canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people s fears. in an open letter he called on them not to turn the election into a competition about who can most effectively frighten voters about terrorism asylum and crime. he said they should concentrate instead on issues such as the environment international development and the arms trade family policy and the reform of the criminal justice system. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said: we have fought a very positive campaign. i think he will want to look quite carefully at what jack straw said about michael howard. in a speech to the foreign policy centre mr straw said of the tory leader: he is clever fluent and tactical but he is not wise. he lacks strategy and good judgment and his quick temper and impetuosity too often get the better of him. the foreign secretary told the bbc: i was making the observation that because of michael howard s impetuosity you can get lurches of policy. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said: people are already really turned off by the kind of campaign the others are fighting and you will see us putting emphasis on some of these huge issues facing the world particularly the environment. labour s focus on the economy as their key message - came on the day a new report was published by the institute of fiscal studies suggesting that household incomes have fallen for the first time in more than a decade. the ifs says the drop partly reflects measures announced in what it called the chancellor s tax-raising budget of . the treasury dismissed the research as complete rubbish . party election supremo alan milburn said the apparent drop in average incomes was because self-employed people had been affected by a world downturn which hit their profits. since the reported average take-home income had risen by % in real terms if you took out the self-employed mr milburn told bbc radio s today programme. mr brown also dismissed the figures insisting that the typical family has been much better off under labour.

356,green fear for transport ballot the green party is concerned thousands of residents may not be able to vote in edinburgh s transport referendum. edinburgh city council is to ballot constituents on proposals to introduce congestion charging in the capital. but green msp mark ballard fears people not on the council s edited electoral register may miss out. local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over non-statutory matters such as the transport referendum. therefore residents who have exercised their right to have their details left off the list could miss the chance to vote. however there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of february s voting deadline. mr ballard said: this vote will set the future of transport in edinburgh for decades to come. it is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in edinburgh city and the surrounding areas are registered to vote in the ballot. many people are not aware that they may miss out on their chance to have a say. everyone involved in this debate - both for and against - wants the ballot to be as fair and representative as possible and that means encouraging people to take part. the ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the council s proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it. the outcome of the referendum will be known next month after the ballot forms are sent out and returned to the council. towards the end of february the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme and the other parts of its transport package.

1531,security scares spark browser fix microsoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser. the revamp has been prompted by microsoft s growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals. test versions of the new program called ie are due to be released by the summer. the announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates microsoft chairman and chief software architect during a keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco. although details were scant mr gates said would include new protections against viruses spyware and phishing scams. this last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information. in a bid to shore up the poor security in ie microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the ie browser. microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a microsoft anti-spyware program. an own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of . the decision to make internet explorer is widely seen as a u-turn because before now microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system. a new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows codenamed longhorn which is due to appear in . the current version of internet explorer is four years old and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera. there are also persistent rumours that search engine google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on firefox. in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november . estimates of how many users firefox has won over vary widely. according to market statistics gathered by websidestory firefox s market share is now about % of all users. however other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to %. some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the firefox browser. internet explorer still dominates with a share of about % but this is down from a peak of almost % in mid-.
234,itunes user sues apple over ipod a user of apple s itunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an ipod to play songs. he says apple is breaking anti-competition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site. apple which opened its online store in after launching the ipod in uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the ipod. californian thomas slattery filed the suit in the us district court in san jose and is seeking damages. apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice the lawsuit states. the key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like itunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market according to ernest gellhorn an anti-trust law professor at george mason university. as a practical matter the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims prof gellhorn said. apple has sold more than six million ipods since the gadget was launched and has an % share of the market for portable digital music players market research firm npd group has reported. more than million songs have been sold by the itunes music store since it was launched. apple has unlawfully bundled tied and/or leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players and vice-versa the lawsuit said. mr slattery called himself an itunes customer who was also forced to purchase an apple ipod if he wanted to take his music with him to listen to. a spokesman for apple declined to comment. apple s online music store uses a different format for songs than napster musicmatch realplayer and others. the rivals use the format or microsoft s wma format while apple uses aac which it says helps thwart piracy. the wma format also includes so-called digital rights management which is used to block piracy.

1671,us cyber security chief resigns the man making sure us computer networks are safe and secure has resigned after only a year in his post. amit yoran was director of the national cyber security division within the us department of homeland security created following the / attacks. the division was tasked with improving us defences against malicious hackers viruses and other net-based threats. reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation. mr yoran took up his post in september and his first task was to get the cyber security division up and running. the organisation had a staff of about people and a budget of about $ (£.). the division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make us networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace. in the last months mr yoran oversaw the creation of a cyber alert system that sends out warnings about big hitting viruses and net attacks as they occur. the warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks. the cyber security division also audited us government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network. the next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers. mr yoran s division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals. despite this success mr yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week reportedly only giving one day s notice to bosses at the department of homeland security. amit yoran has been a valuable contributor on cyber security issues over the past year and we appreciate his efforts in starting the department s cybersecurity program said a department of homeland security spokeswoman. some reports have suggested that mr yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against net-based threats in the wider homeland organisation. an attempt by us politicians to pass a law to promote mr yoran and raise the profile of his department s work is now mired in congress.

291,freeze on anti-spam campaign a campaign by lycos europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold. earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. but the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words stay tuned . no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign. lycos europe s make love not spam campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. people were encouraged to download the screensaver which when their pc was idle would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at % capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. but the plan has proved controversial. monitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline. the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page with the words stay tuned . the numerical internet address of the site has also changed. this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site. the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. attacking a spammer s website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick said graham cluley senior technology consultant for sophos. not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.

1138,euro firms miss out on optimism more than % of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects a survey of bosses suggests. their biggest worries are not terror threats but over-regulation low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. there is one exception: firms in western europe - but not the uk - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. when business advisers pricewaterhousecoopers (pwc) conducted the same survey two years ago nearly % of bosses were gloomy about their prospects. global business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. after a string of corporate scandals in the united states - from enron to worldcom - the sarbanes-oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. across europe meanwhile all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called ifrs. hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors. already about % of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries and another % plan to do so in the future. possibly as a result the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year with just % of companies calling it a significant threat or one of the biggest threats . but pwc s global chief executive samuel dipiazza said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers. according to frank brown global advisory leader at pwc the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: one risk in one region - for example the middle east - won t kill your business anymore. surprisingly the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the us dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore unlike even a year ago when it was cited as the third-largest problem. mr dipiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had adjusted to the new reality of a euro that buys $. and more while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates. - for the survey pricewaterhousecoopers interviewed chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of .

1910,hospital suspends no welsh plan an english hospital has suspended plans to stop treating welsh patients who have waited more than three months. hereford county hospital had earlier said that from the new year patients waiting longer than this would be taken off waiting lists for hip and knee operations. gps in wales had feared patients could be pushed to the back of another queue. but after talks with powys health board the hospital called off its plan until health chiefs meet early in january. hereford hospital trust caused an outcry when it sent out a letter telling patients that for financial and administrative reasons it planned to turn down some orthopaedic patients. shocked health officials in powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals. andy williams chief executive of powys local health board had said it was a totally unacceptable way to behave . mr williams had said he did not think it was a welsh-english issue but said hereford hospital was struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to powys . he had told bbc radio wales: i have written straight back to the trust... to insist they withdraw this threat and treat the patients i am paying them to treat. but after the hospital had agreed to the suspension mr williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure welsh patients continued to be treated there. he said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between england and wales. the target is months for welsh patients but just three months in england. the contract with the powys health board was worth £ a year for the hospital and accounts for % of its patients. in a statement before the suspension of the idea the welsh assembly government said the situation was unacceptable . but powys local health board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate said the assembly government. although we will be challenging hereford s decision we will put in place appropriate care for our patients. they will be contacted by their gps in the next week. earlier david rose chief executive of hereford hospitals nhs trust had said: it is with real regret that we have taken this step. we want to continue providing an excellent and fast service to powys people but can only do this if we are paid to provide the service. in our waiting time will fall to a maximum of -months and we want powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital. we appeal to powys local health board to allow powys people to choose hereford for their treatment.

164,ukip candidate suspended eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. john houston was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views including the return of the british empire were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be made available to law-abiding members of the community and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said: we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire. the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations which they are uniquely able to do. mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party s manifesto but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. he told bbc news: he appears to have said these things. we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. it is simply a distraction from the task in hand the eu constitution not individual idiocies. mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying: i feel ukip have over-reacted and overshot the runway. peter nielson who is ukip scotland chairman said he had suspended mr houston on friday night. he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken. he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party. he added: i can t comment too much at the moment i have one version from him but i haven t seen the papers yet.

2207,california sets fines for spyware the makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home pcs could face hefty fines in california. from january a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. the legislation which was approved by governor arnold schwarzenegger is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing pc users in the coming year. the software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. at its worst it has the ability to hijack personal data like passwords login details and credit card numbers. the programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate. one form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user s web-surfing. it can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. in washington congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills but california is a step ahead. the state s consumer protection against spyware act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. it also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. consumers are able to seek up to $ in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. the new law marks a continuing trend in california towards tougher privacy rights. a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that % of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that on average each one is harbouring separate spyware programs. currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and ad-aware.

964,gta sequel is criminally good the grand theft auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition. the certificate gta: san andreas for the playstation could have got away with merely revisiting a best-selling formula with a more-of-the-same approach. instead it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps carefree over all the and true crime-shaped opposition. even in the year that will see sequels to halo and half-life it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic. the basic gameplay remains familiar. you control a character on this occasion a youth named cj who sets out on a series of self-contained missions within a massive environment. cj can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push-bike to a city bus to a plane. all come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family. to make things worse he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town and blackmailed by crooked cops played by samuel l jackson and chris penn. the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas comprising three major cities: los santos which is a thinly-disguised los angeles san fierro aka san francisco and las venturas a carbon copy of las vegas. san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing. its ability to capture the ambience of the real-world versions of these cities is something to behold assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since vice city. the streets and vast swathes of countryside are by turns gloriously menacing grungy and preppy. flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail the game s overall look particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets is stupendous. the outstanding bread-and-butter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on. cars handle more convincingly than ever a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds and there s more traffic to navigate than before. park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway and within seconds there will be a huge pile-up. pedestrians are also out in force and are a loquacious bunch. cj can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad. they will pass comments on his appearance and credibility aspects that the player now has control over. clothes tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini-games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool. the character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym. he will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up but will swell up as a result of over-eating. and at last this is a gta hero who can swim. at a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young san andreas violence or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence are sure to inflame the pro-censorship brigade. developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality and in some respects ramp it up from past outings. when hijacking a car for example cj will gratuitously shove the driver s head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle. indeed the tone is darker than the jokey vice city. the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy setting of the last game. this title incidentally is set in but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists. the wit is still present just more restrained than in previous outings. a further reason for this is that the incredible range of in-vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options where gta games trademark humour is anchored. the quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off-the-chart. the game s rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed. it is a testament to san andreas magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws but plus-points are so numerous that the niggles don t detract. the on-screen map for instance is needlessly fiddly an unwelcome change from past editions. there is also a very jarring slowdown at action-packed moments. and the game suffers from the age-old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission. but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive. you simply will not be bothered by these minor failings. san andreas is among the few unmissable games of .
1717,borders rail link campaign rally campaigners are to stage a rally calling for a borders rail link which was closed in to be reopened. they will mark the anniversary of the line closure which ran from edinburgh through the borders and on to carlisle with a walk at tweedbank. anne borthwick of campaign for borders rail said reopening the waverley line would restore the area s prosperity. msps are considering the reintroduction of passenger rail services through midlothian to the borders. campaigners have said that reopening the waverley line which could cost up to £ would be a huge economic boost for the borders. in borders council said the area s economy had suffered since the closure. ms borthwick said the lobby group was determined to keep the pressure on the scottish executive. we are hoping that many people will join us in a march to mark the anniversary of the closure of the waverley line she said. campaign for borders rail is the biggest independent lobby group in scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the borders and eventually to carlisle. we believe that it is time for the scottish executive to commit to the first phase of the project by pledging to fund the line between edinburgh and tweedbank in the first instance and then investigate extending the line in the future. ms borthwick said reopening the line would be a prosperous move and protect the character of the scottish borders. a study in which was commissioned by the executive scottish borders council midlothian council and scottish borders enterprise found that a half-hourly service from tweedbank to edinburgh could cover its operating costs. it also found that a half-hourly service from gorebridge to edinburgh could cover operating costs and that a freight railway joining the west coast main line at longtown could also be reinstated.

1703,sport betting rules in spotlight a group of mps and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport. the parliamentary group on betting and gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year. it followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport such as that done using the internet and mobile phones has led to more cheating. the all-party group recommended ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting. they include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years. lord condon head of the international cricket council s anti-corruption unit who originally made the call for longer prison sentences said the two-year penalty was derisory . you could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports. symbolically a higher penalty perhaps as the bill passes through the two houses might be appropriate. the report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters and for bookmakers to set up audit trails - something the new betting exchanges already do - to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced. lord faulkner of worcester who chaired the inquiry said: whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges - because of the facility they provide to bet against a result - has increased the potential for corruption. it is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately. the panel s aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right. as well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves. betting exchanges allow punters to back (to win) but also lay (to lose) a horse. this means they can control their odds at winning by placing their money both ways.

1812,fannie mae should restate books us mortgage company fannie mae should restate its earnings a move that is likely to put a billion-dollar dent in its accounts watchdogs have said. the securities & exchange commission accused fannie mae of using techniques that did not comply in material respects with accounting standards. fannie mae last month warned that some records were incorrect. the other main us mortgage firm freddie mac restated earnings by $ (£.) last year after a probe of its books. the sec s comments are likely to increase pressure on congress to strengthen supervision of fannie mae and freddie mac. the two firms are key parts of the us financial system and effectively underwrite the mortgage market financing nearly half of all american house purchases and dealing actively in bonds and other financial instruments. the investigation of freddie mac in june sparked concerns about the wider health of the industry and raised questionsmarks over the role of the office of federal housing enterprise oversight (ofheo) the industry s main regulator. having been pricked into action the ofheo turned its attention to fannie may and in september this year said that the firm had tweaked its books to spread earnings more smoothly across quarters and play down the amount of risk it had taken on. the sec found similar problems. the watchdog s chief accountant donald nicolaisen said that fannie mae s methodology of assessing measuring and documenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported by generally accepted accounting principles.

1766,china to overtake us net use the chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years says a report. china s net users number but this represents less than % of the country s . billion people. market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the million us users of the net by . the report says that the country s culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations. already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations said william makower chief executive of panlogic. in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare. this combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china. only % of chinese homes have telephones according to reports. net usage tends to happen in the evening said mr makower they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf& its fundamentally different usage to what we have here he said. net use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country s eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends said mr makower. many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes. what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life. for instance said mr makower credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt. the most popular way to pay is cash-on-delivery he said and that s quite a brake to the development of e-commerce. the arrival of foreign banks in china due in could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare said mr makower. but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living. a large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar he said. generally it s more difficult for the government to be able to control it. its real value is as an open window onto what s happening elsewhere in the world he said. government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else. familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet. it s a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it said mr makower.
2068,online games play with politics after bubbling under for some time online games broke through onto the political arena in . the us presidential election provided a showcase for many aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads. experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society. the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of : the iowa game commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean. more than followed suit including frontrunner elections president forever and the political machine which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign including having to cope with the media. others helped raise the stakes during the bush/kerry contest by highlighting a candidate s virtues or his vices. the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers. when i started researching political games at the university about five years ago i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen said gonzalo frasca computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen. i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved added the uruguayan-born researcher who has so far created games for two political campaigns. many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com. the aim is to comment on international news events via games. the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way. video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation mr frasca told the bbc news website. this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay cambiemos an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country s problems could be solved by working together. it s up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games. ultimately dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes fears and beliefs. children learn a lot about the world through play. there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up. but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns. this is hardly surprising compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web. only a few years ago most politicians did not have a webpage while now it is almost a must-have. dr frasca said: political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games. they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them. it will not replace other forms of political propaganda but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns.

1129,fightstar take to the stage charlie simpson took his new band fightstar to the stage on friday night just hours after officially announcing his departure from pop band busted. he was greeted by a sell-out crowd at the university of warwick. confirmation of busted s long-rumoured split had come earlier in the day when simpson held a press conference in london with bandmates matt willis and james bourne. all three band members stressed that the break up was amicable although bourne admitted he was devastated to hear of simpson s departure. this has been a really difficult decision -year-old simpson revealed i hope the fans will understand. while simpson declared he would look back with pride on busted s enormous success his focus turned immediately to fightstar with friday s press conference coinciding with the start of the band s -date tour of the uk. fuelled by this news all tickets to see charlie s first post-busted live appearance - at the university of warwick s student union - sold out rapidly. mike eccleshall the venue s promotions coordinator said: tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days but sales went mad after the news broke. we had completely sold out by . with queues outside the venue long and expectations high the pressure was on fightstar to impress. although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any busted concert. gone were the screaming girls to which simpson had become accustomed. support act brigade fronted by simpson s brother played a short set first and were met with general approval. when fightstar eventually took to the stage around however a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd. unfortunately the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as simpson s guitar amplifier failed to work. as sound technicians rushed to fix it other band members did their best to improvise. when they eventually got under way fightstar s blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received. far heavier and less commercial than busted s chart-topping pop-punk the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fan-base. warwick student helen clutterbuck admitted: i came to check out fightstar because of all the controversy. i ve never heard them before but i m pretty impressed. less impressed were fellow students ryan crabbe and gordon rennie who observed with fightstar charlie has clearly progressed from busted s sound but they re still not very inspiring. fightstar played for around minutes showcasing material from their forthcoming ep called they liked you better when you were dead due for release in february.
2063,campbell rescues arsenal sol campbell proved to be an unlikely match-winner to earn arsenal a hard-fought win at portsmouth. the england defender lashed home a -yard shot for his first goal in months to take arsenal back into second spot five points behind chelsea. but before campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to pompey striker ricardo fuller. in the first half he blasted wide when clear and his control let him down in the second half when well placed. portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny arsenal space in the early stages. but their marking was slack at a corner and patrick vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him yards out. a mistake by arjan de zeeuw let thierry henry in behind the pompey defence on minutes but as he bore down on goal linvoy primus got in a saving tackle. with just fuller as an out-and-out striker portsmouth s shape made life difficult for arsenal. but a delightful touch by robin van persie gave henry a sight of goal although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble jamie ashdown. ashdown caused hearts to flutter on minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and kolo toure headed just wide and as arsenal began to press van persie blasted over a good opportunity after henry had set him up. henry took a quick return pass from vieira but ashdown was out quickly to block and there were some anxious seconds for pompey as the ball ran loose before matthew taylor cleared. after playing second fiddle portsmouth should have taken the lead on minutes. referee howard webb played a good advantage to allow steve stone to send gary o neil away but having shrugged off toure the pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from yards. as half-time approached henry teased a shot through a ruck of players and inches wide. at the other end fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as toure closed him down. fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on minutes when patrik berger s break and slipped pass played him clear. but a poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under vieira s challenge referee webb was not interested. fuller paid the price when he gave way on minutes to aiyegbeni yakubu who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury. but it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from ashdown to cling on to van persie s shot as henry sniffed for scraps. portsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper manuel almunia had to stand his ground to beat away a powerful shot from berger. arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of campbell. the england defender needed little invitation as pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past ashdown. arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when mathieu flamini escaped his marker to flash a header wide from henry s free-kick. almunia went full length to grab berger s long-range shot while ashdown palmed away substitute dennis bergkamp s shot. ashdown griffin de zeeuw primus taylor stone o neil faye (berkovic ) berger lualua fuller (yakubu ). subs not used: hislop quashie cisse. almunia lauren toure campbell cole pires flamini vieira clichy van persie (bergkamp ) henry. subs not used: lehmann fabregas senderos hoyte. cole. campbell . . h webb (s yorkshire).
235,consumer spending lifts us growth us economic growth accelerated in the third quarter helped by strong consumer spending official figures have shown. the economy expanded at an annual rate of .% in the july to september period the commerce department said. the figure marked an increase on the .% growth recorded in the second quarter but fell short of the .% rate pencilled in by forecasters. the increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year. it was a little softer than the consensus but not a real surprise said gary thayer an economist at ag edwards & sons. friday s growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the november presidential election. democrat challenger john kerry has criticised president george w bush s handling of the economy pointing to a net loss of over jobs since mr bush took office. analysts said the economy was still not growing fast enough to stimulate large-scale job creation. it s a pretty good growth rate but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs said robert brusca chief economist at fact and opinion economics in new york. however president bush is expected to point to commerce department figures showing that consumer spending grew at .% in the third quarter up from just .% in the second as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth. consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the us. the weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the us federal reserve will raise interest rates next month economists said. the economy regained some traction in the third quarter but the growth is not robust ag edwards thayer. i think that means the fed can take its time raising rates. we ll probably see one more rate hike before the end of the year. in an effort to pre-empt rising inflation the federal reserve has pushed through three quarter-point rate rises since june this year taking borrowing costs to .%. on the financial markets the dollar fell slightly against the euro and the yen while the dow jones index of leading us shares was little changed.

1133,economy stronger than forecast the uk economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the .% reported according to bank of england deputy governor rachel lomax. private sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates ms lomax said. other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in uk house price growth she pointed out. this means that despite a strong economic growth base rates will probably stay on hold at .%. official data comes from the office for national statistics (ons). though reliable ons data takes longer to publish so now the boe is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. recent work by the bank has shown that private sector surveys add value even when preliminary ons estimates are available ms lomax said in a speech to the north wales business club. the ons is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on friday. the mpc judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate ms lomax said. the bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. rachel lomax cited the late as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published but substantially revised upwards years later. the statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past she said. improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the monetary policy committee (mpc) makes the right decisions she said. the bank of england is working in tandem with the ons to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. her remarks follow criticism from the house of lords economic affairs committee which said the mpc had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the % target. a slowdown in the housing market and this year s surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky leading to a more uncertain outlook. this year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the and ms lomax said. the mpc will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past years. decisions on interest rates are made after the mpc gathers together the range of indicators available every month. the clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction ms lomax intimated. in economic assessment there is safety in numbers.

844,why cell will get the hard sell the world is casting its gaze on the cell processor for the first time but what is so important about it and why is it so different the backers of the processor are big names in the computer industry. ibm is one of the largest and most respected chip-makers in the world providing cutting edge technology to large businesses. sony will be using the chip inside its playstation console and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms. the technology inside the cell is being heralded as revolutionary from a technical standpoint. traditional computers - whether they are household pcs or playstation - use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer. the cell technology on the other hand uses multiple cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously. this gives it processing power an order of magnitude above its competitors. whilst its rivals are working on similar technology it is sony s which is the most advanced. the speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years but the memory technology that accompanies the cell is a huge leap in performance. using a technology called xdr created by american firm rambus memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by intel. perhaps more important than any of the technology is the cell s role in the imminent war on living rooms . the big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as dvd players and hi-fis. companies like microsoft and sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the tv of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place. microsoft has already made its first tactical move into this area with its windows media center software which has been adopted by many pc makers. sony had a stab at something similar with the psx - a variation on the playstation - last year in japan although this attempt was generally seen as a failure. both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles to make them as powerful as pcs will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack. sony and ibm want to make sure that the dominance of the pc market enjoyed by microsoft and intel is not allowed to extend to this market. by creating a radically new architecture and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room shutting out their rivals. once they have established themselves under the tv there is no doubt that they hope to use this as a base camp to extend their might into our traditional pcs and instigate a regime change on the desktop. cell is in fact specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house. the links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach cell processors in entirely different systems. sony hopes to put cells in televisions kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip. each cell will be linked to the others creating a vast home network of computing power. resources of the cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other so that you can programme your microwave from your tv for example. this digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the cell processor and there are as with all things a number of reasons it could fail. because the processor is so different it requires programmers to learn a different way of writing software and it may be that the changeover is simply too difficult for them to master. you can also guarantee that microsoft and intel are not going to sit around and let cell take over home computing without a fight. microsoft is going to be pushing its xbox as hard as possible to make sure that its technology not sony s will be under your tree next christmas. intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to cell so that it doesn t lose its desktop pc dominance. if cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice however it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future. the revolution might not be televised but it could well be played with a videogame controller.

777,eu fraud clampdown urged eu member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in eu funds on a consistent basis the uk s public spending watchdog has said. the national audit office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling the eu still had no common definition of fraud. it also expressed concern that for the year the european court of auditors had qualified the eu accounts. the nao urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. it said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent. the report said: member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the european anti-fraud office on a consistent basis. as the court has now qualified its opinion on the community accounts for a decade it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of eu revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of eu resources. it said there were cases of reported fraud or irregularities in eu funds in the uk in worth £. ( euros) up from cases worth £. in . at the same time reported fraud throughout the eu dropped from cases worth £ to cases worth £. edward leigh chairman of the commons public accounts committee said britain had to set an example when it assumed the eu presidency. any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the uk taxpayer given that we are the second largest net contributor to the community he said. departments responsible for administering eu funds need to make sure that they re doing everything possible to weed out improper spending. the government must take the opportunity afforded by the uk presidency of the eu to press the commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity and raise overall standards of financial management. a spokesman for the european anti-fraud office said the organisation agreed with the nao s assessment of fraud reporting. the quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state and there is room for improvement spokesman jorg wojahn said. he added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud with the statistics studied by nao providing a good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud .
167,top judge clashes with ministers the uk s top judge has revealed he has clashed with ministers about how the heads of public inquiries are chosen. lord woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence. but he told mps the lord chancellor lord falconer was insisting he should have the final say in such cases. lord hutton s inquiry into the death of dr david kelly sparked debate about who should run inquiries. the government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against lord woolf s wishes. lord woolf who is lord chief justice of england and wales was giving evidence to the commons public administration select committee s inquiry into public inquiries. he said he had not been involved in the choice of lord hutton who as a law lord did not come under his jurisdiction. but he argued he should have a veto on whether judges generally should chair a particular inquiry and if so which judge it should be. in written evidence to the committee lord woolf said: i have so far failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue ... i intend to maintain my position and will press for this safeguard to be in any future legislation. judges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue such as the intelligence on iraq s weapons of mass destruction he said. he argued: the subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved. in addition the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed the judiciary as a result of the appointment may be seen as siding inappropriately with the government. he told the mps: anything that tends to undermine the confidence of the public in the judiciary worries me. lord woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns. but that situation could change with new legal reforms. the issue had been overlooked when a new agreement was drawn up about those responsibilities and the dispute had emerged in later discussions. what i am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement [on appointing a judge] it doesn t happen he said. lord woolf said he did not think there would be difficulties but he wanted to establish the principle. a department for constitutional affairs spokeswoman said lord woolf and lord falconer agreed about what happened in practice. their disagreement is about whether the legislation should include a requirement for consultation or concurrence - a very narrow dispute in lord woolf s words she said. as lord woolf also acknowledged it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice. judges are free to decide for themselves whether to accept positions as inquiry chairs. parliament will examine the issue next year when it debates a new bill about public inquiries.
966,italy to get economic action plan italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country s sputtering economy on thursday night in rome. he will present an action plan for the development of italy in a meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders. mr berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (r&d) spending and the competitiveness of small firms. also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system. the prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at gmt. the government has been accused of underfunding r&d making it harder for italy to compete with other european nations and leading to a brain-drain of the country s brightest talents. analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. as a result they say italy s corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. at the same time bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts a situation that is hampering italy s entrepreneurial spirit. the government says that it has set about tackling the problems adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of italy s million population. according to il sole ore italy s business newspaper the government will focus on opening up markets infrastructure research making more incentives available bankruptcy law the slow pace of the justice system . mr berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by . euros ($.; £.) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend. he has also promised to cap spending on transport education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit. italy plans to raise as much as euros from privatisations in including a partial flotation of the post office and utility enel. critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make italy s problems worse. limiting government spending will lead to job losses they counter while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy. the country has been one of the eurozone s worst economic performers in recent years. growth was .% in up from just .% in and .% in - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. at the same time business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards. without a pick up in national growth they say the money could eventually run out bringing italy s economy to a juddering halt. consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of italy s economy.
981,tutu s guantanamo release call archbishop desmond tutu has called for the release of the remaining inmates at guantanamo bay and terror suspects detained without trial in the uk. his comments follow news that all four britons held by the us in the cuban camp will be freed within weeks. the south african archbishop said detentions without trial were unacceptable and distressing . twelve foreign nationals are being held indefinitely without trial in the uk under anti-terror laws. referring to the detentions in cuba archbishop tutu told bbc news: it is utterly unacceptable. the rule of law is in order to ensure that those who have power don t use their power arbitrarily and every person retains their human rights until you have proven conclusively that so-and-so is in fact guilty. moazzam begg from birmingham and martin mubanga richard belmar and feroz abbasi from london have been held by the us at guantanamo bay for almost three years. on tuesday foreign secretary jack straw told the commons that the us had agreed to release the four after intensive and complex discussions over security. the britons were detained as part of the us-led war on terror . the archbishop added: whilst we are saying thank you that these have been released what is happening to those left behind we in south africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable. now if it was unacceptable then how come it can be acceptable to britain and the united states. it is so so deeply distressing. following mr straw s announcement lawyer louise christian who represents mr abbasi and mr mubanga said the government should have acted sooner. foreign nationals detained in the uk are being held at belmarsh and woodhill prisons. in december the house of lords the uk s highest court ruled that the anti-terror measures broke human rights laws. but the men are still behind bars. archbishop tutu criticised the measures saying: i am opposed to any arbitrary detention that is happening even in britain. shami chakrabarti director of civil rights group liberty has called on the government to practise what it preaches and either free or charge the detained men. but the home office defended the measures. a spokesman said: these individuals cannot currently be prosecuted because some evidence such as that provided by third parties cannot safely be disclosed in criminal proceedings without putting others at risk. it is also currently the case that intelligence gained from covert intercepts cannot be used in a court of law.

174,mps to debate euthanasia laws mps are preparing to debate a bill which critics claim would legalise euthanasia by the back door . the bill would give legal force to living wills where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated. the mental capacity bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment. but christian groups say it could mean doctors withholding food and fluids even if they think it inappropriate. ministers insist the mental capacity bill - for england and wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life. the bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decisions about their own treatment unless proved otherwise. it would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf which could be challenged by doctors. critics fear it could allow killing by omission through withdrawing treatment. an amendment to the bill - specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death - has been tabled by former conservative leader iain duncan smith. ninety one mps have signed a petition backing the amendment. mps could vote on it later on tuesday during the bill s report stage debate. the bill will then go to a third reading and be debated in the lords before becoming law. the christian medical fellowship (cmf) and lawyers christian fellowship (lcf) said the mental capacity bill would allow euthanasia by the back door . peter saunders of the cmf said it believed advance refusals should be only advisory not legally binding. cmf is concerned that patients will make unwise and hasty advance decisions to refuse food and fluids without being properly informed about the diagnosis and the expected course their illness will take he said. the lcf s andrea williams said there were too many loopholes that could be abused by unscrupulous doctors . ex-labour minister frank field told bbc two s newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to do away with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets. constitutional affairs minister david lammy said laws affecting people with dementia needed updating. mr lammy told bbc news labour mps would not get a free vote as the law was being strengthened not changed. we are against euthanasia we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law he said. doctors are saying they want more clarity. patients are saying they want more clarity. the making decisions alliance which includes the alzheimer s society age concern mencap and the national autistic society said misunderstandings over the bill had to be cleared up. it will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity the alliance said in a statement. the british medical association also backs the bill saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others. debate on legalising euthanasia has intensified in the uk because of cases like that of motor neurone patient diane pretty. she died two years ago after losing a legal battle to allow her husband to help her commit suicide.
173,commons hunt protest charges eight protesters who stormed the house of commons chamber during a debate on the hunting bill have been charged with disorderly conduct. the men were arrested in september after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted. those charged included otis ferry the -year-old son of rock star bryan ferry and luke tomlinson a close friend of princes william and harry. they were charged under section of the public order act police said. five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside charing cross police station on monday evening after the charges were formerly put to them. the men s solicitor matthew knight said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence. there is no offence of trespassing in the house of commons - it is not a criminal offence he said. if parliament wanted to make entering the house of commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so but it can t do so retrospectively. we are not prosecuted for that. we are prosecuted for a public order act offence. we are not guilty of it. they will appear at bow street magistrates court on december a police spokesman said. otis ferry a former eton pupil and joint leader of the south shropshire hunt said: i have no regrets. we have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country. one of the men david redvers from hartpury gloucestershire said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges. the other protesters are john holliday a huntsman from ledbury herefordshire robert thame who plays polo with princes charles in team highgrove auctioneer andrew elliot from bromesberrow near ledbury point-to-point jockey richard wakeham from york and former royal chef nick wood . the september protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in parliament square. four of the men ran out from behind the speaker s chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. the five tried to confront mps before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber. speaker michael martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the house of commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. in november the use of the parliament act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in england and wales. however many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. last week the countryside alliance said more than hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. the alliance said the february meets would show the new law was impossibly difficult to determine and open to different interpretations.

1290,hanks greeted at wintry premiere hollywood star tom hanks was in london s leicester square for the uk premiere of polar express. the west end landmark was turned into a festive landscape complete with snow and carol singers to celebrate the arrival of the animated film. this is leicester square like you ve never seen it before said hanks who plays five roles in the movie. polar express is based on a children s book which tells the story of a young boy s journey to meet santa claus. the -year-old actor crossed a three-metre high bridge built in the square which he said was almost impossible to get across . hundreds of fans greeted the star all wearing santa hats and mince pies were on offer. hanks said that the new film has an elegant message . christmas is a special time of the year and you get out of it what you put into it added the two-time academy award winner. i believe in the spirit of christmas and i think that s embodied in santa claus he said. polar express uses technology similar to that used in lord of the rings to bring gollum to life. the performance capture technique enables hanks to play a number of roles including the eight-year-old boy who is at the centre of the story and father christmas. it is directed by robert zemeckis who has previously worked with hanks on forrest gump and castaway.
540,bank holds interest rate at .% the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at .% in a widely-predicted move. rates went up five times from november - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since august. recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending as well as in mortgage approvals. and retail sales disappointed over christmas with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence. rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers optimism causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium. the brc said britain s retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade. today s no change decision is correct said david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce (bcc). but if there are clear signs that the economy slows the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. dismal reports from the retail trade about christmas sales are worrying if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending. mr frost added: the housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. it is widely accepted that if house prices start falling more sharply the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably. cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had slowed in recent months in response to rate rises but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity he said. interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time. on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front as the office for national (ons) statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november - for the fifth month in the past six. the ons said manufacturing output dropped .% in november matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists expectations of a .% rise. manufacturers organisation the eef said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. it also said there was evidence that manufacturers confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain. so far the evidence suggests that last year s rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing said eef chief economist steve radley. however should the business outlook start to deteriorate the bank should stand ready to cut rates. some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to % before that happens. the bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at % a year - if economic conditions worsen.
152,lib dems demand new inquiry a judge should look into the david blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered the lib dems say. sir alan budd s inquiry linked the ex-home secretary to the speeding up of a visa claim by his ex-lover s nanny. but he could not say whether mr blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems. lib dem spokesman mark oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying. he told bbc news: i m extremely concerned that individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened. that must be bad for government it must be bad for public confidence in the system. mr oaten said people would be mystified why sir alan s inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up. he said: there is a strong case for a judge-led judicial review of this because of course next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. it may be about something even more important than that. so we do need to understand what took place and who was involved. the tories criticised the lib dem stance saying mr oaten had initially said he accepted mr blunkett s word unless further evidence emerged. but lib dem officials say mr oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.
305,faultless federer has no equal roger federer - nice bloke fantastic tennis player - the ultimate sportsman. when lleyton hewitt shook his hand after getting another thrashing a third in as many months the australian said; you re the best. how right he is. the stats speak for themselves: titles from finals during - three of them grand slams - and final victories in a row going back to vienna . that s an open-era record. hewitt at times in houston showed form which easily matched his grand slam-winning efforts of and . but he was outplayed. twice. hewitt along with andy roddick and marat safin is sure to be prominent during . but realistically all three will be fighting for the world number two ranking. according to all those players and even federer himself the swiss star is in a different league. right now i feel that a little bit he told bbc sport. i ve dominated all the top ten players. they say nice things about me because i have beaten them all. i am dominating the game right now and i hope it continues! the number one player in the world is also the main man for promoting the sport off court. he has just been voted by the international tennis writers as the best ambassador for tennis on the atp tour. he has time for everyone. every match from first round to final is followed by a series of press interviews in three languages; english french and swiss-german. after a major win there are extra requests obligations and interviews all seen through to the end with courtesy and most importantly good humour. you guys are funny i have a good time with you guys he said genuinely happy to talk into yet another tape recorder. i see you pretty much every day on the tour so to give away an hour for interviews is really no problem for me. if i can promote tennis and the sport then that is good for me. people say thanks back and that is nice. what a refreshing attitude from someone who could easily dominate the sports pages for a decade. it sums up his modest personality. shortly after collecting a waterford crystal trophy a mercedes convertible and a tasty cheque for $. federer addressed the houston crowd and concluded by saying thanks for having me . now he just needs to find a way of winning the french open the one grand slam to so far elude him.
137,metal slug offers retro fun like some drill sergeant from the past metal slug is a wake-up call to today s gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings. with its hand-animated sprites and side-scrolling this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. but a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. and yes that includes halo . simply choose your grunt and wade through five side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. it is also the toughest game you are likely to play as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on. players must battle soldiers snowmen zombies giant crabs and aliens not to mention the huge screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels. the shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers instead to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. tanks jets and submarines can be commandeered as well as cannon-toting camels elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq. doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls and while this is a tough nut to crack it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go. and at a mere £ metal slug is as cheap as sliced fried spuds as the man says. of course most of you will ignore this lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation metal slug is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates eye.
1754,home phones face unclear future the fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. according to the study more than million people in the uk germany us and south korea now only use a mobile. it showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. the nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter between mobiles and to friends. in the uk % of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile. however when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared. in the us and germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds. in all the countries where interviews were carried out older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile. women aged or above almost never use a mobile phone the research found. the move to mobile was most pronounced in south korea where % of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile. % said they would not get a landline if they moved house. many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the cosiness of making a call there. nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap reliable and providing good call quality. the survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless. some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years. polling firm mori interviewed more than people in the uk us germany and south korea for the survey.

1200,tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were robbed at manchester united after pedro mendes shot clearly crossed the line but was not given. the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can t we just stop the game and get the decision right said jol after the - draw. but at the end of the day it s so obvious that pedro s shot was over the line it s incredible. we feel robbed but it s difficult for the linesman and referee to see it. mendes shot from yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear. jol added: we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line it was a metre inside the goal. what really annoys me is that we are here in watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn t told about it. we didn t play particularly well but i am pleased - even now - with a point although we should have had three. mendes could not believe the goal was not given after seeing a replay. he said: my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. it was a very nice goal it was clearly over the line - i ve never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. it s really really over. what can you do but laugh about it it s a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn t count. it s not every game you score from the halfway line. manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that s that technology should play a part in the game ferguson told mutv. what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays. but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can t make up his mind after seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on. thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. so you wouldn t be wasting a lot of time. i think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. i think that would be an opening into a new area of football. arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford that just reinforces what i feel - there should be video evidence said wenger. it s a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.

2191,iraqi voters turn to economic issues beyond the desperate security situation in iraq lies an economy in tatters. a vicious cycle of unemployment poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. so there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock. first rule of law then the economy says radwan hadi deputy managing director of aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy blackwatch petroleum services which entered iraq in . mr hadi s view about what the new government s priorities should be is shared by many iraqis. the economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of sunday s election according to bristol university political scientist anne alexander who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war iraq. job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the iraqi people s wish list. nobody knows exactly how many iraqis are out of work but it is clear that the situation is dire. estimates of iraq s unemployment rate vary but we estimate it to be between -% the washington-based independent think-tank the brookings institution says in its iraq index. but some progress has been made largely thanks to the country s oil revenues which have exceeded $ since june . iraq s infrastructure is on the mend with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply irrigation telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. but serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. one iraqi woman told ms alexander about her frustration as she watched tv adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from baghdad s pharmacies. observes mr hadi: the economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer the poor get poorer. an indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people private banks operate only one of which is run in accordance with islamic banking principles. hopes are high for the future of finance so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. national bank of kuwait has bought a majority stake in credit bank of iraq the jordanian investment bank export & finance bank has bought % of national bank of iraq. foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. bechtel s efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. but the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work observes ms alexander. it is seen as a selling off of iraq s assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of iraqi businesses and iraqi workers she says. consequently the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow % foreign ownership of iraqi assets she explains. in the west it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal baathist regime used to look after the majority of iraq s citizens rather well in terms of job creation social security and healthcare. opinion polls suggest that people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things ms alexander says. yet in some areas of the economy investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed insists mr hadi an iraqi who left the country three decades ago. i think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast mr hadi says. iraq s vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth. many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way. but there are exceptions. mr hadi s blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. blackwatch s baghdad-based affiliate falcon group has dozens of people working for it across the country in kirkuk and baghdad and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues mr hadi points out. these guys are trying to work. the iraqi business people will do business at all times. life goes on in iraq the people take responsibility they want to live normal lives.

2187,jones files conte lawsuit marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs. the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $ (£) in the suit. conte whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday conte said: i stand by everything i said . jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in . her lawsuit filed in the us district court in san francisco said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs . conte s statements the suit added were false and malicious . after the abc television program earlier this month jones lawyer richard nicholls said: marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never ever used performance-enhancing drugs. victor conte is a man facing a -count federal indictment while marion jones is one of america s most decorated female athletes. mr conte s statements have been wildly contradictory. mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination. mr conte is simply not credible. we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed. the sport s ruling body the iaaf is taking a cautious approach to conte s allegations but contacted the us anti-doping agency. communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte for further information . but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. if it is felt there is case to answer it would be for its national governing body (usa track and field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action he added. the us anti-doping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. and i am sure like ourselves they will be watching the television programme with great interest. jones who is under investigation for steroid use by the us anti-doping agency has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed. jones who did not win any medals in athens in august has never failed a drugs test. meanwhile conte who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering is due to face trial in march.

2156,dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career. even the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season. but then dallaglio has always been his own man. ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions. to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong. an integral part of a sustained period of success for england dallaglio s crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in . rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby. never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way. dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in . it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born. displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard. within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captain s band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the lions tour to south africa. although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team-mate martin johnson he played a massive role in the - series victory. but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglio s career hit the buffers at speed in . first came the last-minute defeat to wales in which dallaglio s decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam. worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy. with sensational allegations of drug use - of which he was subsequently cleared - splashed across the front pages a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper. but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson. as a member of a new-look england side on the long road to world cup glory - a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned - dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again. yet another setback arrived in as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglio s involvement on the lions tour to australia. rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen. one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre. the only player to play every minute of england s world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england s historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters. following johnson s retirement dallaglio s career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain. while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio s second spell as captain losing five of their eight post-world cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations. dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of england s most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country. the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable. the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglio s role as captain. but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the -year-old. although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglio s massive influence on english rugby.
1162,moyes u-turn on beattie dismissal everton manager david moyes will discipline striker james beattie after all for his headbutt on chelsea defender william gallas. the scot initially defended beattie whose dismissal put everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost - saying gallas overreacted. but he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again. he said: i believe that i should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct. moyes added: my comments on saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when i had only had the opportunity to see one very quick re-run of the incident. the club website also reported that beattie who seemed unrepentant after saturday s match insisting gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if he had headbutted him has now apologised. moyes continued: although the incident was totally out of character - james has never even been suspended before in his career - his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his team-mates. james did issue a formal apology to myself his team-mates and to the everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done. he will now be subjected to the normal club discipline. he is a competitive player but a fair player and i know how upset he is by what has happened. however i must say that i do still believe the chelsea player in question did go down too easily. speaking immediately after the game moyes said: i don t think it was a sending-off i have been a centre-half in my time and i would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that. not in a million years would john terry have gone down in the same way. i have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them. what has happened to big strong centre-halves i thought it was a push initially and i still don t think it was a sending-off. an angry beattie initially said: he (gallas) would have stayed down a lot longer if i had headbutted him. i can tell you it wasn t an intentional headbutt. we were chasing a ball into the corner and william gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off. he was stopping as we were running and i said to myself if you re going to stay in my way i ll go straight over you . our heads barely touched and it wasn t an intentional headbutt.
663,muslim police stops more likely uk muslims should accept that people of islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police a home office minister has said. hazel blears said innocent muslims would be targeted because of the search for islamic extremists. qualifications for religious leaders to enter the uk could also be made tougher she told a commons inquiry. her comments have been described as irresponsible and outrageous by the islamic human rights commission (ihrc). the threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of islam or who are falsely hiding behind islam the salford mp told the commons home affairs committee. it means that some of our counter-terrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the muslim community. it was a reality that should be recognised she said. if a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area she added. on ministers of religions such as imams she said faith groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills such as civic knowledge and ability to engage the community should be demanded. last year ministers introduced a requirement that ministers should speak english to a certain level. ihrc chairman massoud shadjareh accused ms blears of playing an islamophobia card in the run-up to a general election. she is demonising and alienating our community he said. it is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community. this sort of comment is just music to the ears of racists. later the prime minister s official spokesman urged people to put ms blears comments into context. the minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community but that was not what was happening the spokesman said. what is happening is that those powers are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community. it is not aimed at a particular community it is not police policy to aim these powers at a particular community he added. statistics showed that of the people found guilty of terrorist acts in the uk since the september attacks only four of the whose ethnic backgrounds were known were muslim he added figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics. figures showed that for / asians were . times more likely to be stopped and searched compared with . times more likely in the previous year. separate figures on police searches in england and wales carried out under the terrorism act showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted. muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws. in / .% searches under the laws were on asian people even though they make up .% of the population. last july the police were accused of islamophobia by muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of asians targeted had risen by % since the introduction of anti-terror laws.
781,europe backs digital tv lifestyle how people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change following the launch of an ambitious european project. in nice last week the european commission announced its networked & electronic media (nem) initiative. its broad scope stretches from the way media is created through each of the stages of its distribution to its playback. the commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly when on the move at home or at work no matter who supplies the devices network content or content protection scheme. more than experts were in nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as nokia intel philips alcatel france telecom thomson and telefonica. it might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. but again and again speakers stated they could not see incompatible stand-alone solutions working. a long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required. the european commission is being pragmatic in its approach. they have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that nem encompasses. the nem approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline pick out the best bring them together and identify where the gaps are. where it finds holes it will develop standards to fill them. what is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. this is bound to please if not surprise many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the commission will be to identify a solution for different digital rights management (drm) schemes. currently drm solutions are incompatible locking certain types of purchased content making them unplayable on all platforms. with the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally the prize for being the supplier of the world s dominant drm scheme is huge. although entertainment is an obvious first step it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare energy efficiency and control of the smart home. the -year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the ec has been funding for a number of years. simon perry is the editor of the digital lifestyles website which covers the impact of technology on media
1585,abortion not a poll issue - blair tony blair does not believe abortion should be an election issue arguing it is a matter for individual conscience. the prime minister s spokesman set out mr blair s view after the top catholic in england and wales backed michael howard s stance on abortions. the tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from weeks to and has said current rules are tantamount to abortion on demand . the prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law. mr blair s spokesman said: the catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context. his words came as cardinal cormac murphy o connor the archbishop of westminster backed mr howard s stance and distanced himself from labour. in a statement he said abortion was a very key issue saying: the policy supported by mr howard is one that we would commend on the way to a full abandonment of abortion. cardinal o connor claimed labour had developed the notion that it was the natural party of catholics but he said: we are not going to suggest people support one particular party. the family planning association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later. more than women in england and wales had terminations last year of which fewer than % were carried out between and weeks. in the cosmopolitan interview mr howard said: i believe abortion should be available to everyone but the law should be changed. in the past i voted for a restriction to weeks and i would be prepared to go down to . all three main parties say the issue is one for each mp s conscience rather than one where there is a party-wide policy. mr howard stressed his views were his personal views. shadow home secretary david davis said he understood mr howard had been signalling that a conservative government would allow a commons vote on the issue. mr blair and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy also gave their views during interviews conducted as part of the magazine s high heeled vote campaign. mr blair who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the catholic faith despite regularly taking communion said abortion was a difficult issue . however much i dislike the idea of abortion you should not criminalise a woman who in very difficult circumstances makes that choice. obviously there is a time beyond which you can t have an abortion and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue. mr kennedy said he had previously voted for a -week limit but medical advances mean i don t know what i would do now . the roman catholic archbishop of cardiff the most reverend peter smith told bbc radio s today programme that the church merely wanted people to reflect on issues in light of the gospel before voting. anne weyman chief executive of the family planning association asked: what is the benefit to women or to the potential child of forcing a woman to have a baby anti-abortion group the pro-life alliance congratulated mr howard on his new stance but said it did not go far enough.
1511,dogged federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic. top seed federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed - in the first set. but ljubicic who beat tim henman in the last eight dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool though turning on the style to win the deciding set -. the match was a re-run of last week s final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam where federer triumphed but not until ljubicic had stretched him all the way. i really wanted to get off to a good start this time and i did and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm federer said. that took me all the way through to - - - on his serve and i almost ran away with it. but he came back and that was a good effort on his side. ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set. i didn t start badly but then suddenly i felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. and with roger if you relax for a second it just goes very quick he said. after those first three games it was no match at all. i don t know it was really weird. i was playing really well the whole year and then suddenly i found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court. but despite his defeat the world number was pleased with his overall performance. i had a chance in the third and for me it s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match. it s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that i m up there and belong with top-class players.
1446,mobile picture power in your pocket how many times have you wanted to have a camera to hand to catch an unexpected event that would make headlines with a modern mobile phone that has a camera built in you no longer need to curse you can capture the action as it happens. already on-the-spot snappers are helping newspapers add immediacy to their breaking news stories headlines where professional photographers only arrive in time for the aftermath. celebrities might not welcome such a change because they may never be free of a new breed of mobile phone paparazzi making their lives a bit more difficult. already one tabloid newspaper in la is issuing photographers with camera phones to help them catch celebrities at play. it could be the start of a trend that only increases as higher resolution phone cameras become more widespread; as video phones catch on and millions of people start carrying the gadgets around. only last week the world media highlighted the killing of the dutch film maker theo van gogh notorious after making a controversial film about islamic culture. one day later de telegraaf a daily amsterdam newspaper became news on its own when it published a picture taken with a mobile phone of mr van gogh s body moments after he was killed. this picture was the story said de telegraaf s image editor peter schoonen. other accounts of such picture phone users witnessing news events include: - a flight from switzerland to the dominican republic which turned around after someone took a picture of a piece of metal falling from the plane as it took off from zurich (reported by the swiss daily le matin). - two crooks who robbed a bank in denmark were snapped before they carried out the crime waiting for the doors of the building to be opened (reported by the danish regional paper aarhus stiftstidende). but this is not just about traditional media lending immediacy to their stories with content from ordinary people it is also about first-hand journalism in the form of online diaries or weblogs. it has been called open source news or even moblog journalism and it has flourished in the recent us election campaign. not many people walk around with their cameras but they always have their mobile phones with them. if something happens suddenly all these mobiles sort of appear from nowhere and start taking pictures said digital artist henry reichhold. he himself uses mobile phone pictures to create huge panoramic images of events and places. you see it in bars you see it everywhere. it s a massive thing mr reichhold told the bbc news website. with some picture agencies already paying for exclusive phone pictures especially of celebrities there are also fears about the possible downside of this phenomenon. it could become a nuisance for public figures as higher resolution picture phones hit the market with five megapixel models already being launched in asia. already on us photojournal site buzznet there is a public album full of snaps of celebrities many of which were taken with camera phones. tabloid newspapers in the uk and many monthly magazines invite readers to send in images of famous people they have seen and snapped. but there are other positive uses of picture mobile phones that may balance these uses. for instance in alabama in the us camera phones will be used to take snaps at crime scenes involving children and help the authorities to arrest and prosecute paedophiles. and in china s capital beijing courts have adopted mobile phone photos as formal evidence. for henry reichhold this is progress: that s the whole thing about the immediacy of the thing. i can see that happening a lot more.
1344,solutions to net security fears fake bank e-mails or phishing and stories about id theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce say e-business experts. trust in online security is falling as a result. almost % of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. the survey of more than people reported that % were not willing to hand over personal information online. it is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats said security firm rsa which carried out the poll. an estimated million britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by banks in particular. i don t think the threat is overplayed barry beal global security manager for capgemini told the bbc news website. he added: the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability. ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said. card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. if we do that they will indemnify us he said. many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual s identity. several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget. last year a street survey found that more than % of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate. on average people have to remember four different passwords. some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. in a separate survey by rsa % said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. for many the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard. activcard is just one of the many companies like rsa security which has been trying to come up with just that. rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for seconds. many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. activcard s method is more complex. it is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with uk banks. steve ash from activcard told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification. the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online. the end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both. the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as seconds before it changes. it combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions. you take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and a code is given. if you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction. the clever bit happens back at the bank s secure servers. the code is validated by the bank s systems matching the information they expect with the customer s unique key. each individual gets a key which is unique to them. it is a -bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack said mr ash. it means that in a typical security attack explains mr ash even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode. by the time they go back [to use the information] the code has expired so they can t prove who they are according to mr ash. in the next few years mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. pcs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards. the gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants (pdas) and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them. the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around he said.
1050,tough schedule delays elliot show preview performances of the £ musical billy elliot have been delayed to give the child actors a less arduous rehearsal schedule. director stephen daldry made the decision to re-schedule the previews to protect the young stars. three boys will rotate the demanding role of ballet dancer billy which requires them to sing dance and act. the show s opening night on may at the victoria palace theatre in london remains unaffected by the changes. preview performances will now be held on and april. this is one of the most ambitious projects i have been involved with said daldry. the decision has been made to push back our preview performances in order to give our company with a cast including children a little extra time so they are as fully prepared as possible. he added: the young billy elliots in particular making their professional stage debuts in the west end will benefit from a little extra time to familiarise themselves with all aspects of the production. the three boys playing billy are james lomas george maguire and liam mower . the other major child parts will also be rotated between young actors. such are the demands of the show that producers set up a stage school in newcastle to train potential stars for the show. child labour laws also mean the young actors can only work for a limited period each week. adult actors in the show include tim healy as billy s father and haydn gwnne as his dance teacher mrs wilkinson. sir elton john has composed the music. daldry directed the successful film version of billy elliot adapted from lee hall s script. both were nominated for oscars alongside julie walters who played billy s teacher.
351,new consoles promise big problems making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money an industry conference has been told. sony microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual games expo in los angeles in may. these so-called next generation machines will be faster than current consoles and capable of displaying much higher-quality visuals. for gamers this should make for better more immersive games. in a pre-recorded video slot during microsoft s keynote address at the game developers conference held last week in san francisco famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film - believed to be battle angel alita. the game s visual quality would be like a lucid dream said mr cameron. but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop. the first new console microsoft s xbox is not expected to reach the shops until the end of . games typically take at least months to create however so developers are grappling with the hardware today. according to robert walsh head of brisbane-based game developer krome studios next generation games will cost between $- to make with teams averaging staff in size taking two years to complete a title. such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio said mr walsh. if you re a start-up i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for $ however good you are he said. mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games. one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright the creator of the best-selling the sims games. the founder of california s maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game spore. spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures. starting with an amoeba-sized organism the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs jaws and other body parts evolve. eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities trading and fighting and even building space ships. advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players. these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet. mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game. i don t want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins - i want them to be george lucas or dr seuss explained mr wright. few games have hinted at the scope of spore but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers. instead of employing lots of artists to create models of the digital creatures spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers. the thing i am coming away with [from the conference] is that next generation content is going to be really expensive and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market said mr wright. i d like to offer an alternative to that. new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference. oxford-based natural motion launched endorphin . which enables artists to direct a virtual actor . the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics. endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs for instance or crumples up after a gunshot. artists can blend together these visual sequences and include the results in their games. the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand and so lessens the need for larger art teams. another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester start-up genemation. its latest tool gencrowd enables artists to create unique photo-realistic human faces for games involving lots of people. gencrowd works by blending together elements of an in-built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities. the software can create up to new heads an hour. one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games. even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices. the game developers conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games. a niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago gdc s mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates. mobile games are a fast-growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound and are thus more suitable for playing games. furthermore the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world. it s predicted that by two billion people will own a mobile phone. the growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by john batter general manager at ea mobile. ea mobile is a division of electronic arts the biggest games publisher. until recently electronic arts had been dismissive of games for phones. the last time you checked ea wasn t in this business mr batter admitted. but he said ea now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises. ea plans to release up to mobile games over the next months. the first will be a version of its need for speed racing game created by ea mobile s -person development team. mr batter predicted that by mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on sony s upcoming psp handheld console. owain bennallack is the editor of develop magazine.

2014,desailly backs blues revenge trip marcel desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when chelsea take on barcelona on wednesday. the french star was part of the chelsea side crushed - at the nou camp in the champions league quarter-final second leg in . things will be totally different this time he told bbc sport. now everyone knows about chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. they are one of the major clubs in europe and the pressure will be on barcelona. chelsea have not played barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. the blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at stamford bridge - courtesy of two goals from tore andre flo and one by gianfranco zola. but they collapsed in the second leg going down to strikes from rivaldo () luis figo dani and patrick kluivert. former chelsea captain desailly who is now playing for al-gharafa in qatar says there is no comparison between that side and the current blues team who are top of the premiership. mentally they are much stronger even though a lot of their players are young the -year-old said. we made some mistakes at the nou camp in - a lot of them were individual mistakes. it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality. world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for £. from ac milan in by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in . desailly says the russian s arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. the whole of chelsea is different now - the chairman the manager and all the players he said. everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. since that game in chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season. desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the world cup and european championship with france the champions league in with marseilles and with ac milan two serie a titles and the fa cup in with chelsea. he is now winding down his career in qatar alongside the likes of frank lebeouf josep guardiola titi camara gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid- who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday - paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta. i m happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level he said. i made a vow to costacurta that as long as he plays i will continue to play. and it s amazing that paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.
47,campaign cold calls questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls . the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people s voting intentions. the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. the information commissioner s office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept. telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service (tps) lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications. the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps. a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. but that did not happen for voter identification calls. when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said. so it is not covered by the telephone preference service. he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again. a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers. she said: we do apply tps but in line with the law. we would not do things that are not allowed in the law. assistant information commissioner phil jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. but classic market research such as a poll of voter intentions did not constitute direct marketing he said. if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future this should be clear to the voter concerned said mr jones. if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them the party may well be in breach of the regulations. in summary whether a party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed. mr jones said the watchdog received very few complaints on the issue. earlier lib dem chairman matthew taylor wrote to the watchdog saying: the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal. he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls. i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner. mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.
595,branson show flops on us screens entrepreneur sir richard branson s us tv show the rebel billionaire is proving a flop in the ratings. the programme suffered poor viewing figures on its debut on the fox network three weeks ago and has lost one in five of its viewers since then. the show is seen as fox s answer to the apprentice featuring tycoon donald trump a ratings hit for rivals nbc. sir richard s show sees a group of young entrepreneurs compete to become the president of his business empire. the rebel billionaire has averaged five million viewers and is in the rankings of all prime-time shows. the apprentice which has already completed its first season is still managing to pull in million viewers while its prime-time ranking is number four. but fox has said it plans to stick with branson s show throughout its -episode run. it s going to remain on the air said the network s spokesman scott grogin. creatively we re extremely pleased with the show and hope the audience will find it he added. contestants on sir richard s show are confronted with business tasks to solve similar to the apprentice. they are also subjected to stunts like walking a plank suspended in mid-air. the rebel billionaire has marketed itself as a less materialistic version of the apprentice with sir richard shown jumping out of a taxi while trump is seen in a limousine.
1902,labour trio had vote-rig factory three labour councillors in birmingham were caught operating a vote-rigging factory an election court has heard. police found the trio handling unsealed postal ballots in a deserted warehouse in the city during a late-night raid in june the hearing was told. the votes were later counted towards that month s english local elections. the men elected to the aston ward deny collecting votes fraudulently. the judge presiding has indicated the whole postal voting system is under scrutiny. deputy high court judge richard mawrey qc told the hearing at the birmingham and midlands institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming general election. the special election court the first in living memory to hear allegations of vote-rigging opened in birmingham last month. the case against muhammad afzal mohammed islam and mohammed kazi is being brought by local liberal democrat supporters. they claim the trio benefited from the widespread misuse of postal votes during the june election. ravi sukul counsel for the petitioners accused the three men of being deeply involved in illegal practices. witnesses saw them carrying several bags from their campaign office which the men drove to a warehouse on an industrial estate off birch road east the court was told. the police were alerted and called to the premises. mr sukul said: when (the officers) arrived there in the middle of the night they saw a large room with a long table and six asian men present. hundreds of documents and unsealed envelopes were scattered all over the table. the police officers left the warehouse but were later ordered back to seize the documents. when the officers left all the envelopes and papers were scattered mr sukul said.

1031,games firms face tough future uk video game firms face a testing time as they prepare for the next round of games consoles the industry warns. fred hasson head of tiga which represents independent developers said that more uk firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles. three leading uk video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as they struggled to adapt. microsoft sony and nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next months. microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that xbox will be released in the us before the end of . the new machines will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games. mr hasson said: in the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers. he said there were about independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close. once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities he said. mr hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines. that figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the bbc news website - codemasters climax and rebellion. as consoles get more powerful the content gets more detailed and that means more cost said gary dunn development director at codemasters which develops games in house and also publishes titles. jason kingsley chief executive of rebellion said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger . he added: we have been through five technology transitions and survived so far. each one has involved the death of some people. all companies said they were investing in new tools - called middleware - in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control. simon gardner president of climax s action studio said: we are investing in superior tools and editors. we are investing upfront to generate this content without the need for huge teams. it s vital we avoid huge teams. he said climax was already directing about % of its resources to preparation for next generation titles. mr dunn warned that companies could face a short supply of programming development and artistic talent. if companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams at some point the talent is going to run out. mr hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more business-like . there are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days. some of them are still making games for peer group approval - that has to stop.

1747,running around the olympics it was back to official duties last week in my role as an ambassador to london s olympic bid. but i still managed to do all my marathon training. all the sporting people on the capital s bid team think i m mad to be taking part in the london marathon. the bid chairman lord coe admitted he would never dream of running a marathon even though he was an olympic middle-distance runner. kelly holmes former hurdler alan pascoe and former sprinter frankie fredericks - who is now an ioc member - all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far. you d have thought all these athletes who have been running for most of their lives wouldn t think it would be that bad. but the only person who was positive about my intentions was tanni grey thompson who has won the london marathon wheelchair race six times. even though it was a very busy week entertaining the international olympic committee s (ioc) evaluation commission i actually found my running schedule easier to follow. when i m at home i get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days i was in london i was in a pressurised situation but i found it easy to relax by running. on wednesday the presentations to the ioc team did not finish until the early evening so i just managed to squeeze in a -minute run. we had an early start on thursday because we had to visit all the olympic sites around london that was pretty shattering but when we got back to the hotel i got back on the treadmill. on friday evening i went along to the special dinner at buckingham palace which was a nice occasion. i never feel guilty about eating especially when i m exercising. and because it was a rest day i didn t have to feel bad about missing my training either. anyway i managed to do another quick run on saturday ahead of the final ioc presentations before heading home for my daughter s birthday. when i was in london i did all of my runs on the treadmill which isn t the same as exercising outdoors. one of the ioc s technical staff from australia ran alongside me one day. we talked about the sydney olympics and that made the time go past more quickly. i do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning. but when you re gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement. it was good to get out on the road for my long run on sunday. after the week i d had i was a bit concerned i wouldn t be able to complete it. but i coped with it very well and even though it was bitterly cold i put in -and-a-half miles - only another to go then. - this year steve will donate all the proceeds from his london marathon efforts to victims of the tsunami.steve will be writing a regular column on the ups and downs of his marathon training for the bbc sport website.he will be raising money through the steve redgrave trust which supports the association of children s hospices the children with leukaemia charity and the trust s own project which aims to provide inner-city schools with rowing equipment.
155,the comic book genius of stan lee stan lee the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit spider-man movies. many marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. born in to poor working-class jewish immigrants from romania stan lieberman got a job in timely publications a company owned by a relative. he was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of . for more than years he was the ultimate hack - knocking out crime stories horrors westerns anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. words of more than two syllables were discouraged. characters were either all good or bad with no shades of grey. so embarrassed was lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. he assumed the dumb name stan lee now legally adopted. by the time he was lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. his british-born wife joan suggested he had nothing to lose and for his swansong should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. after a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of batman superman and wonder woman timely needed to respond. lee s answer in was the fantastic four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. they were to change lee s life and the comics industry forever. lee gave each character individual everyday teenage problems such as dandruff ingrown toenails and acne. they would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. the fan letters poured in. without immediately knowing it stan lee had ushered in the golden age of comics and his imagination was rekindled. his marvel universe spawned the new title of marvel comics. soon after nerdy peter parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of new york s skyscrapers. spider-man was born. he was to become an icon of modern popular culture. spidey as he is affectionately known had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work at home and with his girlfriends. at last the teenager was no longer just the sidekick but the main hero. and the hero was no longer just brawn he had brains too. just because he s a hero and has super powers doesn t mean he doesn t have problems stan lee told the bbc. the incredible hulk the mighty thor iron man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse bigotry and social inequality. radically lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. jack kirby frank miller john romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. daredevil was blind black panther was black and silver surfer pondered the state of humanity. lee s influence remains. some years ago the marvel hero northstar came out of the closet. in its heyday marvel was selling million copies a year. until he retired from editing in stan lee wrote all the copy for marvel s covers. in his stan lee media venture aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet went spectacularly wrong. lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. in though he started a new company entitled pow! (purveyors of wonder) entertainment which is currently developing films and television programmes. his latest project is a superhero based on a real person - jay j armes who has metal claws after losing both hands aged and fights crime with a tiger. but his -year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with x-men the hulk and daredevil have all been turned into hollywood action movies in the last five years. but spider-man has been the biggest box office hit with the original and its sequel taking almost $. (£) in ticket sales around the world - before dvd and merchandise sales are counted. it seems stan lee is as indestructible as his heroes.

1681,fuming robinson blasts officials england coach andy robinson said he was livid after his side were denied two tries in sunday s - six nations loss to ireland in dublin. mark cueto s first-half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes. [i m] absolutely spitting. i m livid. there s two tries we ve been cost robinson told bbc sport. we ve got to go back to technology. i don t know why we didn t. south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the sale wing to gather. kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try. i think mark cueto scored a perfectly legal try and i think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey said robinson. it is how we use the technology. it is there and it should be used. i am still trying to work out the cueto try. i have looked at both and they both looked tries. we are very disappointed and this will hurt there is no doubt about that. we are upset now but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that. we did everything we could have done to win the game. i am very proud of my players and with a couple of decisions this could have been a very famous victory. i thought we dominated. matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop while the likes of charlie hodgson martin corry and lewis moody all came through well. josh lewsey was awesome and every one of the forwards stood up out there. given the pressure we were under credit must go to all the players. we have done everything but win a game of rugby but ireland are a good side. they defended magnificently and they ve got every chance of winning this six nations. england have lost their first three matches in this year s six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september.

1440,nat insurance to rise say tories national insurance will be raised if labour wins the next election tory leader michael howard has claimed. tony blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on wednesday said other tax promises would be left to labour s manifesto. prime minister s questions also saw mr blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. he attacked tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but mr howard said labour had proposed the idea too. the commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. the tories have promised £ in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. mr howard pointed to the institute for fiscal studies predictions that labour will need to increase taxes to cover an £ gap in its spending plans. he accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. it was no good mr blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to mps on tuesday about the top rate of income tax argued mr howard. pointing to national insurance he added: everyone knows tax will go up under labour: isn t it now clear which tax it would be mr blair instead hailed labour s achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. when we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals that money is not wasted he said. on the tax questions he added: we will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto. home secretary charles clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants with only high-skilled workers allowed into the uk from outside the european union. mr blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers would end. that would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers he said. the prime minister ridiculed the tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. he challenged the tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a fantasy island . mr howard read from a letter about the government s own plans at the european council of ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the eu. but mr blair said: all the other countries could not agree on the way forward nor could the un.
331,cebit fever takes over hanover thousands of products and tens of thousands of visitors make cebit the place to be for technology lovers. welcome to cebit was the message from the pilot as we landed the message on flyers at the airport and the message on just about every billboard in town. cebit fever has taken over hanover. hotels have been booked out for months; local people are letting out rooms in their homes to the hoards of exhibitors visitors and journalists. cebit itself is huge the exhibition site could almost be classified as a town in its own right. there are restaurants shops and a bus service between the halls - of which there are . there are more than companies here showing their latest products. the list of them that i was given when i came in is the size and weight of a phone book. one of the mains themes this year is the digital home and one of the key buzzwords is convergence. the entertainment pc is being billed as the replacement for dvd players stereos telephones and computers - offering a one-box solution wirelessly connected throughout a house. to show them off one display has been modelled as a prototype digital lifestyle home by german magazine computer reseller news. we wanted to show how this fits into a living room or workplace to give people a feeling how it would work in their homes said claudia neulling from the magazine. the house has webcams for security in each room which can be called up on the high definition tv connected to the pc in the living room. that pc provides home entertainment movies or music. it can also be linked to the car parked outside which is kitted out with a processor of its own along with a dvd player and cordless headphones for the kids in the back. convergence for me is about how technology the transfer of data can do things that make it easier and more convenient for me as a consumer said mark brailey director of corporate marketing for intel. the real challenge is to show people it s easier than they think and fun. he firmly believes that entertainment pcs are the future but says they have to get past people s fears of frequent crashes and incompatibilities. that is something microsoft is trying to do too - its stand has computers running windows xp media centre edition for people to try out. mobile phones do not escape the convergence theme. samsung is showing off its sgh- a handset with a three gigabyte hard drive that can be used to watch compressed video or as an player. and if you would rather watch live tv than a downloaded movie nec is showing a phone on sale in china which can show analogue tv on its colour screen. i think the most probable application is at somewhere like the train station - if you want to check the status of the soccer game for example said koji umemoto manager of mobile terminals marketing for nec. he admitted that the signal quality is not very good if you are on the move and they do not have plans to launch it in europe at the moment. nokia was happy to demonstrate its an upgrade to the very popular . it now has a . megapixel camera and a music player that can handle multiple formats rather than just . it is also compatible with nokia s new visual radio technology. the handset can receive fm broadcasts and the user can interact with compatible broadcasts using a gprs connection to take part in competitions or get extra information such as the name of the song playing. most companies are reluctant to show prototypes preferring to display products that are already on sale or just about to hit the market. portable media player firm creative showed off a new wireless technology based on magnetic inductance rather than radio - a system some hearing aids use. the benefits over conventional bluetooth are the lack of interference and longer battery life said riccardo de rinaldini creative s european marketing manager. the firm has a prototype headset linked up to a zen micro player. the transmitter on the player creates a private magnetic bubble around the user which is picked up by the headset. the range is only about one metre so it is only suitable for personal use. a single aaa battery is said to last up to hours. creative expects it to hit the market in its final form later this year. even clothing is likely to be part of the convergence trend. adidas has a trainer which according to susanne risse from the company can sense understand and adapt to your running style . it has a battery processor and motor embedded in the sole. buttons on the side allow you to set the amount of cushioning you would like by adjusting the tension on a cable running through the heel. the processor then monitors the surface you are running on and adjusts the tension accordingly. it is being billed as the world s first intelligent shoe .

1480,van gogh festival film withdrawn murdered director theo van gogh s controversial film submission has been pulled from the rotterdam film festival because of security fears. it was one of three of his works to be shown as part of a freedom of expression event in tribute to the late film-maker s life. the film is critical of the treatment of women under islam. its tv screening is thought to have led to his murder. the -day dutch festival begins on wednesday. submission was made with liberal somali-dutch politician ayaan hirsi ali and was due to be shown on january. van gogh was shot and stabbed to death in november several months after receiving death threats following submission s first broadcast on dutch television. two of van gogh s other films will be shown as planned including the theatrical world premiere of his last feature /. festival director sandra den hamer said: the festival reflects what happens around us and within cinema itself. the festival opens with the french film the district court moments of trials made by raymond depardon. the event sees films competing to win three top tiger awards which aim to introduce promising new talent. new sections added to this year s festival include cinema of the future and cinema of the world with special focus on russian and south-east asian productions. there is also an iraqi-german offering entitled underexposure which looks at life in iraq after saddam hussein.
1354,tories attack burglar u-turns tory leader michael howard has accused tony blair of performing u-turns over rules on using force against burglars. the government has ruled out amending the present law which allows reasonable force in self defence. mr howard branded the decision unacceptable saying: it is not householders who should be frightened it s the burglars. home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law. metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using grossly disproportionate force could be prosecuted. the pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and crown prosecution service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. he told mps: if we get the right response from those people we will of course support a change in the law. instead the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. on thursday mr howard told bbc radio s today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. he said: we ve had three policy positions in three months and two u-turns. it s not surprising gordon brown told him: there s nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe. mr howard said the grossly disproportionate test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a -year-old burglar in as he ran away from the farm. but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were weighted overwhelmingly in favour of the householder said mr clarke. he said: the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making. the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue added mr clarke. the director of public prosecutions ken macdonald says only householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last years. those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar tied him up beat him and set him alight he said. tory mp patrick mercer s private member s bill to change the law received a first reading in parliament on wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.
653,lennon brands rangers favourites celtic s neil lennon admits rangers could be considered slight favourites for the old firm cis cup clash but insists his side can still win. lennon concedes rangers are in good form at the moment but they have failed to beat celtic in their last seven meetings. rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks he said. but it s a game we believe we re capable of winning if we play our best he told the evening times. all the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in. without playing at the top of our game we have still been winning matches. at the minute we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in europe so i don t think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out. of course it is a concern when you are losing goals because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets but hopefully we are over that wee run. considering we lost henrik larsson at the end of last season we have still been scoring a lot of goals which is pleasing.
1413,mourinho receives robson warning sir bobby robson has offered chelsea boss jose mourinho some advice on coping under pressure. the pair worked together at barcelona and porto and robson had a word of warning for his protege. it has all gone for him just lately and that is marvellous but sometimes you have to have a bit of humility and learn how to lose said robson. it is when it goes against you and you get a bit of bad luck that you learn and he ll get it straight. robson was speaking after being formally granted the freedom of the city of newcastle. jose is doing very well at the moment robson added of the man who worked for him for six years. he has got one pot - possibly two to follow - a big game against barcelona to come and i cannot see them losing their lead in the premiership. they are in a good position and i would expect them to go on and win it which is a wonderful achievement. what has occurred over the last couple of weeks will stand him in very good stead for the future. if he is intelligent he will take it on board - and he is very intelligent. he will have learned more in the last fortnight than the last eight months. before that it was all about winning. robson also admitted he would relish the chance to get back into management and test his skills against mourinho. i am not in a hurry to take the wrong job but i am ready to take the right job and i feel there is another job in me he added. i know the area i am capable of working in and of course i would like a job in the premiership if one was available. it would not worry me if i had to pit my wits against jose. but it is not just a case of him and me against one another. it would be his team against my team - but i would not be afraid of that.
1424,can smith work scottish wonders the worst kept secret in scottish football was revealed on thursday when walter smith was named as the new national manager. from the moment berti vogts miserable tenure in charge of scotland ended the former rangers and everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post. but is smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football the -year-old takes over at a time when the national side is in the doldrums. scotland have not reached a major finals since the world cup in and reaching germany looks near impossible having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race. and the fifa rankings see scotland listed at an all time low of below the likes of estonia ghana angola and thailand. scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level so smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources. smith s track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game. the man who was alex ferguson s assistant when scotland played at the world cup won seven league titles with rangers. and his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games top names including ferguson and graeme souness who took him to ibrox as his assistant in . characters like souness ferguson and current ibrox manager alex mcleish all cite smith s experience and his expansive knowledge of the scottish game. much was made of vogts inability to express himself to the players and media. that will certainly not be the case with smith. the former dundee united and dumbarton full-back is from the managerial old school - straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better (often with the use of some colourful invective). but it should be remembered vogts came to scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a world cup winner as a player and a european championships winner as a manager. smith will inherit the same problems vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents. and it remains to be seen if smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of vogts preparation work. a fresh start for the scottish national team was imperative and smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands. but will a safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of a magician might be required...
1826,yelling takes cardiff hat-trick european cross-country champion hayley yelling completed a hat-trick of wins in the reebok cardiff cross challenge in bute park on sunday afternoon. the part-time maths teacher beat irish international jolene byrne by metres in the six-kilometre race. another great britain international louise damen finished third as part of the contingent representing england. peter riley who secured bronze for the gb men s team at last month s european championships won the men s race. riley representing england moved away over the last two kilometres to win by metres from ireland s gary murray. glynn tromans - the reigning uk inter-countries and england cross-country champion - came in third place as he continues his comeback from a five-month injury lay-off.
1695,new yob targets to be unveiled fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in england and wales will be named on thursday. ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. a year ago ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and thursday s figures offer a progress check. they will say that in the past year more than anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years. police have also closed crack houses and issued more than dispersal orders breaking up groups of youths in public places. the new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. exeter and cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved. prime minister tony blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of asbos and fixed penalty notices. there are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly. he is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. we have not defeated this problem by any means but shown together what can be done he will say. mr blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance. ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place community support officers (csos). but researchers from leeds university warned that csos could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. more work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before csos they argued in a the study. critics of the government say it has announced more than initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. home office minister hazel blears also revealed this week that about a third of asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.
1265,new browser wins over net surfers the proportion of surfers using microsoft s internet explorer (ie) has dropped to below % say web analysts. net traffic monitor onestat.com has reported that the open-source browser firefox . released on november seems to be drawing users away from ie. while ie s market share has dropped % since may to .% mozilla browsers - including firefox - have grown by %. firefox is made by the mozilla foundation which was set up by former browser maker netscape in . although there have been other preview versions of firefox version . was the first complete official program. it seems that people are switching from microsoft s internet explorer to mozilla s new firefox browser said niels brinkman co-founder of amsterdam-based onestat.com. mozilla browsers - including firefox . - now have .% of the market share the figures suggest. mozilla said that more than five million have downloaded the free software since its official release. supporters of the open-source software in the us managed to raise $ (£ ) to advertise the release of firefox . in the new york times and support the mozilla foundation. there was a flurry of downloads on its first day of release. the figures echo similar research from net analyst websidestory which suggested that ie had .% of users in october compared to .% in june. microsoft ie has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from netscape and its share of users has always stayed at around the % mark. firefox is attractive to many because it is open-source. that means people are free to adapt the software s core code to create other innovative features like add-ons or extensions to the program. fewer security holes have also been discovered so far in firefox than in ie. paul randle microsoft windows client product manager responded to the figures: we certainly respect that some customers will choose alternative browsers and that choosing a browser is about more than a handful of features. microsoft continues to make significant investments in ie including service pack with advanced security technologies and continues to encourage a vibrant ecosystem of third party add-ons for internet explorer. firefox wants to capture % of the market by the end of . other browser software like opera and apple s safari are also challenging microsoft s grip on the browser market. opera is set to release its version . by the end of the year. onestat.com compiled the statistical measurements from two million net users in countries.
904,marsh executive in guilty plea an executive at us insurance firm marsh & mclennan has pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with an ongoing fraud and bid-rigging probe. new york attorney general elliot spitzer said senior vice president robert stearns had pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud. the offence carries a sentence of months to four years in state prison. mr spitzer s office added mr stearns had also agreed to testify in future cases during the industry inquiry. we are saddened by the development marsh said in a statement. the company added it would continue to co-operate in the case adding it was committed to resolving the company s legal issues and to serving our clients with the highest standards of transparency and ethics . according to a statement from mr spitzer s office the marsh executive admitted he instructed insurance companies to submit non-competitive bids for insurance business between and . those bids were then conveyed to marsh clients under false and fraudulent pretences . through the practice marsh was allowed to determine which insurers won business from clients and so control the insurance market mr spitzer s office added. it also protected incumbent insurers when their business was up for renewal and helped marsh to maximise its fees a statement said. in one case an email showed mr stearns had instructed a colleague to solicit a non-competitive - or b - quote from aig that was higher in premium and more restrictive in coverage and so fixed the bids in a way that would support the present provider chubb. the company is also still being examined by us stock market regulator the securities and exchange commission (sec). late last month the sec asked for information about transactions involving holders of % or more of the firm s shares.
657,freeze on anti-spam campaign a campaign by lycos europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold. earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. but the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words stay tuned . no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign. lycos europe s make love not spam campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. people were encouraged to download the screensaver which when their pc was idle would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at % capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. but the plan has proved controversial. monitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline. the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page with the words stay tuned . the numerical internet address of the site has also changed. this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site. the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. attacking a spammer s website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick said graham cluley senior technology consultant for sophos. not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.
31,firefox browser takes on microsoft microsoft s internet explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited firefox . web browser which has just been released. few people get excited when some new software is released especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour. fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version . of the browser is available. the release of firefox . on november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant s internet explorer browser. firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in . much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february. earlier incarnations but which had the same core technology were called phoenix and firebird. since then the software has been gaining praise and converts not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsoft s internet explorer. rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability. internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie. before july this year according to websidestory internet explorer was used by about % of web surfers. that figure had remained static for years. in july the ie using population dropped to .% and by the end of october stood at .%. the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner % of the windows- using net-browsing population. firefox is proving popular because at the moment it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsoft s program. for instance firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. it blocks pop-ups has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed. one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras or extensions produced for it. the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. this has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar google toolbar to a homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. firefox which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans. a campaign co-ordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the $ needed for a full page advert in the new york times. the campaign set itself a target of recruiting volunteers. ten days in to the campaign people had signed up and now about $ has been raised. the ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late november/early december. the surplus cash will be used to help keep the mozilla foundation running. microsoft is facing a growing challenge to ie s hold on the web using population. from alternative browsers such as opera safari amaya and even netscape.

1465,parties plans for council tax anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in when the average english bill rose .%. pensioners protests spread - some marched others simply refused to pay the increase. some such as -year-old elizabeth winkfield said they would rather go to jail. the audit commission found the whole local government finance system was fundamentally flawed and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change. labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. they say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills with a £ lump sum for the over- and last year the government capped some local councils budgets to keep demands down. deputy prime minister john prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be radical reform . the party says this year s increases will be the lowest in a decade. a report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation such as reformed business rates although no decisions have been made. an independent inquiry into its findings the lyons review is due to report back at the end of . the tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. they say they can save £ on government waste of which £. could be used to cut pensioners bills by an average of £. it would not be means tested say the tories because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. instead households where council tax payers are over would get a rebate covering half their bill up to a maximum of £. the tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to their value in - because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band. the liberal democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the usa norway and switzerland. the rate would be set locally but administered by the inland revenue which they say would save at least £. they say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in britain because it puts a ceiling on what the richest pay. the party says it would aim for a £ tax-free personal allowance or a £ allowance for the over-. after that income would be taxed up to £ . the lib dems say their plan is fairer more efficient has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.
714,amex shares up on spin-off news shares in american express surged more than % on tuesday after it said it was to spin off its less profitable financial advisory subsidiary. the us credit card to travel services giant said off-loading american express financial advisors (aefa) would boost its profitability. aefa has more than advisers selling financial advice funds and insurance to . million customers. over the years it has delivered poor profits and even some losses. this is an excellent move by american express to focus on its core businesses and sell off a laggard division which has been a problem for quite some time said marquis investment research analyst phil kain. analysts estimate that a stand-alone aefa could have a market value of $ (£.). the unit was acquired by american express years ago as investors diversified service of minneapolis at a time when firms were amassing one-stop financial empires. however the business of selling investments was never integrated with the rest of the group.
1444,ferguson rues failure to cut gap boss sir alex ferguson was left ruing manchester united s failure to close the gap on chelsea everton and arsenal after his side s - draw with fulham. premiership leaders chelsea and the gunners endured a - stalemate on sunday giving united the chance to make up some ground in the league. but ferguson said: i think what makes it so bad is that both our rivals dropped points at the weekend. it was a great opportunity - and we haven t delivered. united went ahead through alan smith in the minute before bouba diop s superb -yard strike cancelled out the visitors lead in the minute. ferguson described the result as an absolute giveaway after united had earlier missed a host of opportunities to finish off the encounter. he said: it was a good performance - some of the football was fantastic - but we just didn t finish them off. in fairness it s a fantastic strike from the fulham player. the result leaves ferguson s side fourth in the league on points - four points behind arsenal and a further five back from chelsea.
247,steady job growth continues in us the us created fewer jobs than expected in december but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world s biggest economy. according to labor department figures new jobs were added last month. that took s total to . million the best showing in five years. job creation was one of last year s main concerns for the us economy. while worries still remain the conditions are set for steady growth in analysts said. the unemployment rate stayed at .% in december and about jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop. it was a respectable report said michael moran analyst at daiwa securities. payroll growth in december was a little lighter than the consensus forecast but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment. manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it s showing job growth it s a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track. that means that the federal reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. the fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to .% citing evidence the us economic recovery was becoming more robust. job creation was one of last year s main concerns for the us economy and proved to be a main topic of debate in the us presidential election. while demand for workers is far from booming the conditions are set for steady growth. overall compared to the previous year it looks great it just keeps going stronger and stronger and i expect that to be the case in said kurt karl economist at swiss re in new york. meanwhile economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the federal reserve showing an unexpected $. drop in consumer debt in november. a fall in consumer spending which makes up about two-thirds of all us economic activity could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. but economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing which include credit cards and personal loans while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.
1764,nintendo ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. market leader nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played. the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks. far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a handheld prototype. the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen. the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm s pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market. nintendo first launched its gameboy console in and has dominated the market ever since. but its lead can no longer be taken for granted. sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable while start-up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices. we believe the ds will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill said david yarnton nintendo europe s general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. with its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points. it went on sale in the us in mid-november priced $ and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures. japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of to get the device. with more than two million pre-orders for the device in japan nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters - a action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine s wireless capabilities. it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people. the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. super mario ds is a faithful re-creation of the nintendo classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. one thing is for certain. hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds s key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.

900,kenteris denies faking road crash greek sprinter kostas kenteris has denied claims that he faked a motorbike crash to avoid a doping test days before the start of the olympics. kenteris and fellow sprinter katerina thanou are set to learn if they will face criminal charges this week. part of the investigation has centred on whether they staged the crash. kenteris insisted: the accident happened. i went crazy when i found out i had supposedly missed a test and i wanted to rush to the olympic village. kenteris speaking on greece s alter television station also claimed that he asked to be tested for banned substances in hospital after the crash. i told the hospital which was an olympics-accredited hospital to call the ioc and have me tested on the spot but no-one came. after a drama which dominated newspaper headlines in greece as athens prepared for the start of the athens games kenteris and thanou eventually withdrew. but kenteris has continually protested his innocence - and on sunday blamed greek olympic committee officials and his former coach christos tzekos for failing to inform him of the test. the -year-old insisted he will be happy if he is charged so he can clear his name. if a decision is taken to have charges filed against me i will accept it gladly. a prosecution means that the case will be cleared... i want to go to the end and then we ll see who s right and who isn t. kenteris a greek hero after winning gold in the at the olympics in sydney also confirmed that he was due to light the flame at the athens opening ceremony. i had even rehearsed lighting the cauldron he said.

774,uk needs true immigration data a former home office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor uk immigration. barbara roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government. she said this would counter so-called independent groups like migration watch which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent. migration watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures. sir andrew green chairman of the organisation says there is no need for an independent body because office of national statistics data are accurate. he says he opposes large-scale immigration both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture . he said: for example over the next years one household in three will be due to immigration. we are already more overcrowded than india and we are four times more overcrowded than france. ms roche labour mp for hornsey and wood green believes legal migration is something we should welcome. she said her proposals mean we wouldn t have so-called independent experts like migration watch who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view. she went on: what i would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures published them and was independent of government. i think that would go a long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate.
1732,mobiles not media players yet mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players say two reports. despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life said jupiter. a separate study by gartner has also said real-time tv broadcasts to mobiles is unlikely in europe until . technical issues and standards must be resolved first said the report. batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer like video playback video messaging megapixel cameras and games amongst others. bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life. fifty percent of europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets. mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready said thomas husson mobile analyst at jupiter research. mobile music services should be new and different and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches. other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones compared to portable players which can hold up to of music. the mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading after the success of apple s itunes napster and other net music download services. with phones getting smarter and more powerful there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move. in the us services like tivo to go let people transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones. but the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. currently tv-like services where clips are downloaded are offered by several european operators like italy s tim and . mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though said the report. various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. in europe trials in berlin and helsinki are making use of terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles hours a day. the service uses technology one of the standards for mobile tv. but at the end of the european telecommunications institute (etsi) formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld (dvb-h) as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe. operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb-h standard. tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too which expects good quality images at low prices according to analysts. people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens said gartner. digital video recorders like europe s sky+ box and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch. as a result people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. more powerful smartphones like the xda ii nokia sonyericsson and the orange offering web access text and multimedia messaging e-mail calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. a report by analysts instat/mdr has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by % over the next five years. it says that smartphones will make up million out of million handsets shipped globally by .

2046,tory expert denies defeatism the conservatives campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned michael howard the party could not win the next general election. the times on monday said australian lynton crosby told the party leader to focus on trying to increase the tories commons presence by to seats. but mr crosby said in a statement: i have never had any such conversation... and i do not hold that view. mr howard later added there was not one iota of truth in the report. the strategist helped australia s pm john howard win four elections. mr howard appointed mr crosby as his elections chief last october. mr crosby s statement said: the conservative party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and controlled immigration over the past week. it added: the labour party will be wanting to do all they can to distract attention away from the issues that really matter to people.
1813,yukos unit buyer faces loan claim the owners of embattled russian oil giant yukos are to ask the buyer of its former production unit to pay back a $ (£) loan. state-owned rosneft bought the yugansk unit for $. in a sale forced by russia to part settle a $. tax claim against yukos. yukos owner menatep group says it will ask rosneft to repay a loan that yugansk had secured on its assets. rosneft already faces a similar $ repayment demand from foreign banks. legal experts said rosneft s purchase of yugansk would include such obligations. the pledged assets are with rosneft so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of yugansk assets said moscow-based us lawyer jamie firestone who is not connected to the case. menatep group s managing director tim osborne told the reuters news agency: if they default we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit. rosneft officials were unavailable for comment. but the company has said it intends to take action against menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by yugansk. yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. the sale went ahead in december and yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale.
710,criminal probe on citigroup deals traders at us banking giant citigroup are facing a criminal investigation in germany over a controversial bond deal. the deal saw the sale of euros ($.; £.) of government bonds in a few minutes on august with euros-worth then bought back later. the move was widely criticised at the time and now the german regulator has said it has found evidence of possible market manipulation. citigroup said it would continue to co-operate fully with the authorities. we are disappointed that the bafin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved citigroup said. if the traders are found guilty they could face a five-year jail term or a fine reuters reported bafin as saying. however under german criminal law prosecutors cannot pursue citigroup itself. germany s financial watchdog bafin told bbc news it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor. i can confirm that bafin has passed through the case to the public prosecutor a bafin spokeswoman said. it is now a criminal investigation. we found clues of possible market manipulation the spokeswoman said which included signs of linked bond trading ahead of the main trades on august. germany s securities trading act says that if bafin finds such clues it has to put the case in the hands of the prosecutor. regulatory investigations are still going on in france the uk and elsewhere. some citigroup operations elsewhere in the world came under regulatory criticism in . its private banking operation in japan was closed down by regulators in tokyo after an aggressive sales culture led the bank to flout anti-money laundering rules.

607,swap offer for pirated windows xp computer giant microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones. the first-time initiative is restricted to the uk and to users with pre-installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november. until december microsoft said software can be sent to it for analysis if there are doubts about its legitimacy. the company aims to detect illegal traders and turn users of fake versions of windows into legitimate ones. the windows xp counterfeit project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free subject to certain conditions until the end of the year. it is the first time microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world the company told the bbc news website. in june the software giant said that the major security update to windows xp service pack would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system. the upgrade closed security loopholes in xp and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code. the us company invited anyone who had suspicions about their version of windows xp to submit it for testing as soon as possible. the procedure consists of a series of computer checks collating documents and filling out a witness statement. this is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of windows xp software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders said alex hilton licence compliance manager at microsoft. the scheme has also been welcomed by the technology and commerce industry. it is important that users ensure that they are legally licensed to avoid the risks of purchasing and using counterfeit products said david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce. the plan would enable microsoft to gather intelligence about illegal traders in a prompt way which would allow it to take action against software pirates. microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the uk programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries.
195,mp s shock at long lost daughter labour mp stephen pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was out of control during the wild . lucy tracked down mr pound after her birth mother told her he was known as precious at school. despite being told he was a nutter who died at sea she found a reference to mr pound on friends reunited. lucy s mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. mr pound found out about it last year. that happened when lucy wrote to his parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father. mr pound who is now married with two other teenage children said: i was a nutter and i was a sailor but i wasn t dead. he said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a set-up but he then realised all the dates fitted. it was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. i felt guilt in the marrow of my bones said the ealing north mp. i don t blame lucy s mother. i was pretty much out of control. i was when she was conceived. it was a different time - it was pretty wild. mr pound says he rang lucy as soon as he got her letter they met up and have been in contact ever since. describing that first meeting at london s king cross station he said: the earth went from under my feet ... we were walking across the euston road and i took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. we were finishing each other sentences. lucy who was adopted by a family from essex wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. mr pound said his wife maggie had been fully supportive and their two children emily and pelham were pleased to have an older sister.
2066,blog reading explodes in america americans are becoming avid blog readers with million getting hooked in according to new research. the survey conducted by the pew internet and american life project showed that blog readership has shot up by % in the last year. some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the us presidential campaign. despite the explosive growth more than % of online americans have still never heard of blogs the survey found. blogs or web logs are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts opinions or spread news events in their own words. companies such as google and microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs. the rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information with six million americans now using rss aggregators. rss aggregators are downloaded to pcs and are programmed to subscribe to feeds from blogs news sites and other websites. the aggregators automatically compile the latest information published online from the blogs or news sites. reading blogs remains far more popular than writing them the survey found. only % of the million us adults who use the internet had created a blog or web-based diary. getting involved is becoming more popular though with % saying they had posted material or comments on other people s blogs. just under one in of the us s internet users read political blogs such as the daily kos or instapundit during the us presidential campaign. kerry voters were slightly more likely to read them than bush voters. blog creators were likely to be young well-educated net-savvy males with good incomes and college educations the survey found. this was also true of the average blog reader although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities. the survey was conducted during november and involved telephone surveys of internet users.
77,hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break - but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite s bid for champions league glory. hodgson - now in charge at viking stavanger - was at liverpool s clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefa s technical committee. hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe although not in england - where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list. but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last of the champions league. i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge. i am a fervent supporter of the break. it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league. the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage. the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february. hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages explaining: as i said it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries. and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction. in pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot find themselves getting very jaded. the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and perhaps more importantly recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead. the mental side is by far the most important thing. hodgson added: the length of breaks can vary. in italy the break was very short. you just took christmas and new year. it was so short you didn t do anything. you gave the players a week or days off then you were training for a week or days and then went into a game. if it is longer it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them. and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership. he said: if we talk about football at elite level which the premiership is then i would support a winter break. if you examine the demands of the premier league and in particular on players who play international football for their club and country then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally.
1248,o sullivan quick to hail italians ireland coach eddie o sullivan heaped praise on italy after seeing his side stutter to a - victory in rome. it was a hell of a tough game said o sullivan. we struggled in the first half because we hadn t the football. italy played really well. they handled the ball well in terms of kicking it if that s not an oxymoron. we said before the game that it might take until minutes from the end for this game to be won and that s how it turned out. ireland struggled to cope with italy s fierce start and were indebted to skipper brian o driscoll who set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer. we had our first attack in the italian half after minutes said o sullivan. we had a good return with three first-half possessions in their half and we scored twice. the second half was about spending more time in their half. scrum-half peter stringer was also glad that ireland escaped wtih a victory. all credit to them he told bbc sport. we knew it would be tough coming to rome. they always give us a tough game here and they showed a lot of spirit. they had a lot of ball in the first half but we got a few scores when we got into their .
950,uk discriminated against roma the government s immigration rules racially discriminated against roma (gypsies) seeking entry into the uk the law lords have ruled. it follows a home office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people mostly roma from boarding flights to britain from the czech capital prague. civil rights group liberty said it exposed racism at the heart of the government s asylum policy . the home office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone. it said it would look at the implications of the ruling but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because czechs are now entitled to free movement across europe. the screening took place at the airport in july at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering britain. those refused pre-clearance were effectively prevented from travelling to the uk because no airline would carry them. lady hale sitting with lords bingham steyn hope and carswell said many roma had good reason to want to leave the czech republic because of persecution. but she said they were treated more sceptically than non-roma passengers by immigration officers acting on racial grounds . lady hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason. liberty said statistics suggested roma czechs were times more likely to be stopped by british immigration officials at prague airport than non-roma czechs. it took up the case of six unnamed roma czechs refused entry to britain and that of the european roma rights centre which said the measures unfairly penalised roma people. it lost a high court action in october when a judge said the system was no more or less objectionable than a visa control system. he ruled there was no obligation on britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum. the court of appeal then decided the practice almost inevitably discriminated against roma but that this was justified because they were more likely to seek asylum. immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries but it does not allow officers to go further than that. responding to the ruling a home office spokesman said: the scheme was operated two years ago as a short-term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the uk. welcoming the ruling maeve sherlock chief executive of the refugee council said: human rights abuses against the roma in eastern europe are well documented and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group. amnesty international s jan shaw said: that the government s own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse not least in the czech republic. but the chairman of migration watch uk sir andrew green said the house of lords decision was a step in the wrong direction . the basic point is that the government has a duty to control our borders and this decision appears to extend the race relations legislation beyond sensible limits.
1432,fao warns on impact of subsidies billions of farmers livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism the un s food & agriculture organisation has warned. trade barriers and subsidies severely distort the market the fao report on the state of agricultural commodity markets said. as a result the . billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. the most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. the fao report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries. the fao has urged the world trade organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade easing developing countries access to the world market. it also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. it recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation. according to the organisation subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the european union and the us who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. in fact almost wealthy nations spend more than $ (£.; . euros) in agricultural subsidies. the market situation has divided developing nations in two groups the fao said. the first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. for developing countries more than % of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product. these countries are mainly situated in sub-saharan africa latin america and the caribbean.
508,when invention turns to innovation it is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past. when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people s lives substantially. but says nick donofrio senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at ibm it was not the thing itself that actually improved people s lives. it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it. the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs whilst having mobility and access. when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the century we have to think more like this but faster mr donofrio told the bbc news website after giving the royal academy of engineering hinton lecture. the invention discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had. the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered but by themselves they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did. these are not altogether new ideas and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years. but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea method or device will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them. we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology argues mr donofrio industry week s technology leader of the year. the hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work make sense make a difference and life gets better as a result. in the dotcom era there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes. somebody had a new thing that would awe you. you weren t quite sure that it did anything you weren t quite sure if you needed it you weren t quite sure if it had value for it but it was cool. but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives he says will come about slowly subtlety and in ways that will no longer be in your face . it will creep in pervasively. nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways through new superconducting materials to coatings power and memory storage. i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment in an incredible network infrastructure says mr donofrio. pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules and where jewellery clothes and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires screens and keyboards. the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there like air. people will not have to do anything to stay connected. people will know their lives are just better says mr donofrio. trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know. natural interfaces will develop devices will shape your persona and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances. ultimately there will be says mr donofrio no value in being computer illiterate . to some it sounds like a technological world gone mad. to mr donofrio it is a vision innovation that will happen. behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and deep computing says mr donofrio. deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data and integral to this concept is supercomputing. it has value according to ibm because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions like how to refine millions of net search results finding cures for diseases or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates. but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts commands and requirements of a diverse world. as computing and technologies become part of the environment part of furniture walls and clothing physical space becomes a more important consideration. this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience. i am confident that the set [science engineering and technology] industry is going to be short on skills he says. if i am right about what innovation is you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative. women tend to have those traits a lot better than men. eventually women could win out in both life and physical sciences he says. in the uk a dti-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have % representation on set industry boards. ibm according to mr donofrio has %. our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career. the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio. we believe in the whole issue of global diversity he says. our customers are diverse our clients are diverse. they expect us to look like them. as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them.
1984,llewellyn plans wales retirement wales record cap holder gareth llewellyn will retire from test rugby at the end of the six nations. the veteran lock who is at the end of february told bbc wales scrum v that it is time for him to bring down the curtain on his -cap wales career. llewellyn is on a one-season deal with french club side narbonne but said he may consider retiring from all rugby. i don t know what i ll do next year whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career llewellyn said. narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year so i ve got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else but ultimitely coaching is where i d like to end up. i ve done all the coaching awards and everything you can do in that respect so it s just hopefully getting a chance somewhere. fellow locks robert sidoli and brent cockbain who both scored tries in saturday s six nations win in italy are wales coach mike ruddock s preferred starters in the second row. with the resurgence of the dragons ian gough and the adaptibility of lock-cum-flanker jon thomas on the bench llewellyn has not yet made a match-day squad this six nations campaign. but the former neath and ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt. if i do get on the field then brilliant although the boys are doing really well and i m very pleased for them llewellyn added. we ve had some really tough years in wales and the players have been through a hell of a lot. sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away but a few of us dug in there and it s really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now. i was going to retire at the end of the last six nations i d even told some of the boys in the squad about it. but mike (ruddock) asked me to carry on for another season which i ve done still part of the squad still trying to help them out as much as i can. llewellyn made his wales debut in against new zealand as a -year-old having caught the selectors eyes in the all blacks tour match against neath. the player has not looked back since going on to break neil jenkins wales cap record on june in the - loss in argentina. there s been lots of highs - winning the six nations in beating england in i ve been on some great tours and seen some fantastic countries llewellyn said. but i think the best thing of all for me was the time i spent with the players i ve met some great guys in rugby and made some great friends. it ll be a bit strange on international days having to find somewhere to watch wales play but at least i might have time to get my golf handicap down! llewellyn captained neath for seven seasons while being an integral part of the neath-swansea ospreys regional side s first season. but with the ospreys building for the future llewellyn was eventually forced to look to france for employment - digging in his heels during contract negotiations to insist he must be allowed to play for wales.
1809,golden rule intact says ex-aide chancellor gordon brown will meet his golden economic rule with a margin to spare according to his former chief economic adviser. formerly one of mr brown s closest treasury aides ed balls hinted at a budget giveaway on march. he said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules. any rate rise ahead of an expected may election would not affect the labour party s chances of winning he added. last july mr balls won the right to step down from his treasury position and run for parliament defending the labour stronghold of normanton in west yorkshire. mr balls rejected the allegation that mr brown had been sidelined in the election campaign saying he was playing a different role to the one he played in the last two elections. he rejected speculation that mr brown was considering becoming foreign secretary saying his recent travels had been linked to efforts to boost international development. gordon brown s decision to announce the date of the budget while on a trip to china was a sensible thing to do since he was talking about skills and investment at the time mr balls told the bbc. commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise he said it was not within the remit of the bank of england s monetary policy committee (mpc) to factor a potential election into its rate decisions. expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed that house prices are still rising. consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in january. i don t believe it would be a big election issue in britain or a problem for labour mr balls said. prime minister tony blair has yet to name the date of the election but most pundits are betting on may as the likely day.
1326,wenger keeping faith with almunia arsene wenger has pledged to keep faith with stand-in keeper manuel almunia for the crunch week which could define arsenal s season. almunia will start tuesday s champions league group tie against rosenborg and is likely to face chelsea on sunday. wenger said: you don t think i would take out one goalkeeper for just one game do you i don t do that. i have to give him a run for a few games. it s just that i don t want to make this story bigger than it is. wenger insists he has complete faith in the -year-old spaniard who was signed last summer from celta vigo as back-up to jens lehmann. if you look at my career you will see that i have left many big players out for a long time. i ve done it with dennis bergkamp kanu everybody. it s because it s a goalkeeper that s all. it s a usual situation for me. you put your best team out no matter who it is. for me it was not a big mistake at old trafford and i wasn t alarmed by what happened against birmingham either. it s nothing against lehmann. i think he s a great keeper as is almunia. you can only play one of them. these people are not robots - they have good periods and less good periods. just because lehmann doesn t play for two or three weeks or longer or shorter it doesn t mean i ve lost faith in him. but former arsenal keeper david seaman believes lehmann has been harshly treated. seaman told the daily mail: jens is a fantastic keeper. he deserves another chance. he has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first-team choice. with arsenal hit by injuries and suspension inexperienced midfield pair of mathieu flamini and cesc fabregas will line up against rosenborg but wenger is confident they will prove more than capable. it puts a lot of pressure on them but it s a good learning process said wenger. i m not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate. the gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender sol campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club. and the -year-old whose current contract runs out in the summer has made it clear he is determined to achieve champions league success with arsenal. campbell said: it means a lot to me to go through it s everything. we want to carry on in this competition. that s where the best teams in europe are. to be in there playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy is the first thing in my mind. meanwhile thierry henry believes he will be blamed if arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the champions league. henry will captain the side in place of the suspended patrick vieira as the gunners seek the required victory over rosenborg. and the striker said: if we don t win and we go out of the competition like it or not it s going to be my fault. that s the way it is. if the team don t win i know i will be criticised no matter how i play.

45,franz man seeks government help franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion. for any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well he said. but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event. i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he said. kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotland s role in making century music. there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they aren t self-sufficient he said. but so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well. he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however. i don t know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea. kapranos and his glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week s brit awards including best group and best album. their self-titled debut album won last year s mercury music prize and spawned three top singles. he told the -strong audience at the university s reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes. we say i like this . because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual i m riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because i m upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning. kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music adding: there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm. he concluded: we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity. fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed: we need to rediscover our ability to listen. previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking. kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming brits performance. i don t really care about the brits he said. it s going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight. i think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues. also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels. rather than expecting the government - i.e. the taxpayer - to fork out why don t some of the megastars put something back in some of britain s wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc. there are far more important demands on government funds. if they can fund football why not fund music areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash. the government has enough problems funding schools and health services. if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that. as a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it! franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods! i think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no. those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn t be looking for government subsidies. i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship. yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses. there are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal . getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use. as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move. i would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about. only if the proposals make financial sense. franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they d had a government grant to get started they d have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out. however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they re a musician. the government shouldn t fund music - it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment. i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there. i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for! if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn t have to fork out a great deal. yeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternities i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. there is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music - that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. call it a tax on music pollution if you like. though i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos. once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations like save the music in the us.
2011,fiat mulls ferrari market listing ferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of fiat s carmaking operations the financial times has reported. it said fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $ (. euros; £.) settlement with gm about fiat s ownership. steps being considered include listing ferrari and bringing maserati and alfa romeo closer together it said. despite strong sales of alfa romeo fiat s car business is making a loss. under the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. fiat owns a % stake in ferrari -best known for its dominant formula one motor racing team - having first bought into the business in . it considered floating ferrari in but opted to sell a minority stake to italian bank mediobanca for euros ($). that sale valued ferrari - which owns the maserati brand - at . euros. the price tag would change if maserati was stripped out. the financial times said fiat may transfer maserati within its wholly- owned alfa romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. such a move would help alfa romeo and maserati to share marketing distribution and research & development costs. maserati and ferrari sell about cars between them and both companies broke even in . fiat italy s largest private sector employer did not comment on the reported changes. fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with general motors. the us firm agreed to pay $ to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy fiat outright. analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which fiat now had to develop the business.
1075,news corp eyes video games market news corp the media company controlled by australian billionaire rupert murdoch is eyeing a move into the video games market. according to the financial times chief operating officer peter chernin said that news corp is kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies . santa monica-based activison is said to be one firm on its takeover list. video games are big business the paper quoted mr chernin as saying. we would like to get into it . the success of products such as sony s playstation microsoft s x-box and nintendo s game cube have boosted demand for video games. the days of arcade classics such as space invaders pac-man and donkey kong are long gone. today games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible. and with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun. mr chernin however told the ft that news corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target. we are struggling with the gap between companies like electronic arts (ea) which comes with a high price tag and the next tier of companies he explained during a conference in phoenix arizona. these may be too focused on one or two product lines. activision has a stock market capitalisation of about $. (£.) compared to ea s $.. some of the games industry s main players have recently been looking to consolidate their position by making acquisitions. france s ubisoft one of europe s biggest video game publishers has been trying to remain independent since electronic arts announced plans to buy .% of the firm. analysts have said that industry mergers are likely in the future.

2142,rush future at chester uncertain ian rush s future as chester manager is uncertain after he and assistant mark aizlewood refused a severance package. chester have won only two of their last league games but chairman steve vaughan claims he cannot afford to sack the -year-old liverpool legend. vaughan said: i offered a financial settlement so they could resign with dignity but an obvious action is to dismiss them. i haven t because of the finances so technically they re still employees. vaughan claimed that aizlewood had verbally agreed to the offer. but the chester chairman added: after they discussed the offer with their solicitor who also acts as their agent they decided to withdraw the verbal agreement which was disappointing. rush was appointed at the end of august following the departure of former liverpool team-mate mark wright who guided chester to the conference title last season. chester were bottom of league two when rush took over but the former liverpool striker enjoyed an impressive start to managerial life taking the club into the third round of the fa cup and winning the manager-of-the-month award for october. chester s downturn in form culminated in a - defeat at shrewsbury that leaves them hovering just above the league two relegation zone.

1728,wales make two changes for france wales coach mike ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat italy - for saturday s trip to france. kevin morgan takes over from his injured newport-gwent dragons colleague hal luscombe on the right wing. and in the pack neath-swansea ospreys forward ryan jones is preferred at blindside flanker to jonathan thomas. thomas a try-scorer in rome drops down to the bench instead of ian gough while cardiff back rhys williams steps up in place of morgan. luscombe is sidelined by a hamstring problem sustained during the six nations game against italy last weekend. however the experienced and in-form morgan was already pushing hard for a start at stade de france. due to his impressive performances from the bench kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway and the unfortunate injury to hal gives him the chance to start said ruddock. now that ryan jones has recovered from injury we have increased the options in the back row. jonathan thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against italy and scoring a try but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail. for this particular game we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against italy so an extra big ball-carrier in the back-row is thought to be necessary on this occasion. obviously it s a -man game these days and there is every chance that jonathan will be making an impact from the bench. wales have beaten france on two of their last three visits to paris and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first five or six nations title triumph since . graham henry (former wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should be bold when going to france and he was proved right said ruddock. that is a great way to approach the game and something we will further endorse with the players this week. g thomas (toulouse capt); k morgan (newport-gwent) t shanklin (cardiff) g henson (neath-swansea) s williams (neath-swansea); s jones (clermont auvergne) d peel (llanelli); g jenkins (cardiff) m davies (gloucester) a jones; (neath-swansea) b cockbain (neath-swansea) r sidoli (cardiff); r jones (neath-swansea) m williams (cardiff) m owen (newport-gwent). replacements: r mcbryde (llanelli) j yapp (cardiff) j thomas (neath-swansea) r sowden-taylor (cardiff) g cooper (newport-gwent) c sweeney newport-gwent) r williams (cardiff).

1977,row over police power for csos the police federation has said it strongly opposes giving community support officers (csos) the power to detain suspects for up to minutes. the powers - piloted in six areas - were extended to all police forces in england and wales on thursday. the federation said csos do not have the experience training and safety equipment to deal with potentially confrontational situations. but the government said the move would help police build safe communities . police federation chairman jan berry said civilian officers should act as eyes and ears for the police. they should not be placed in potentially confrontational situations - which detaining someone clearly is she said. csos can now use reasonable force to detain suspects for up to minutes while they wait for police officers to arrive. the powers will be granted by chief constables of local forces. ms berry said this dramatically changes their original purpose - to be a visible presence combating low-level crime and anti-social behaviour. she said more powers would mean more paperwork and less time on the street. but home office minister hazel blears defended the move saying it would give the civilian officers just that little bit of edge . she denied their role was changing and said the new powers would not take them away from the streets. the powers that we are bringing in are things that they need to do when they are out patrolling she said. the home office has produced its own report on csos which it describes as encouraging . ms blears said the study shows csos are making a real difference in the fight against crime. but the report also showed that the public is having difficulties distinguishing between a civilian officer and a proper officer. shadow home secretary david davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that csos were having no discernible effect on crime figures. while the answer is a lot more real police the government wants to recruit people who can t arrest anyone he said. bbc home affairs correspondent danny shaw said the research is inconclusive. there are about csos in england and wales but the government intends to have on the streets by at a cost of £. they already have powers to hand out fines for a wide range of offences. the serious organised crime and police bill proposes extra powers to search suspects enforce licensing offences direct traffic and deter begging.

516,labour mp praises tory campaign the conservatives have been a lot smarter in the way they have conducted the general election campaign a labour backbencher has said. derek wyatt said having a five month campaign turned off voters and suggested people were already rather bored of the thing . he wants a greater campaigning role for chancellor gordon brown. labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and mr brown therefore had a prominent role. but mr wyatt argued: by some way he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world. so it would be a tad foolish of the labour party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections. labour s election chief alan milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline mr brown after facing criticism for letting the tories set the agenda. however mr wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget. the mp for sittingbourne and sheppey said prime minister tony blair had been trying very hard to improve his own standing with the electorate through a sort of campaign of trust . but mr blair had been hurt by the iraq controversy he added. a labour party spokesman played down differences with mr wyatt and said mr brown already had a prominent campaign role. this election is a choice between labour taking britain forward and the conservatives taking us back.
340,looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts gartner. more than million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date. the figure was % more than in and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to gartner that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales. all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website. japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years time. they already have tv music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones. but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too according to gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said gartner. third generation mobiles () with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. at the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical. nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms. more likely to drive sales in would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services. the motorola razr phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in she added. this was not a women s thing she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner. western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design said ms milanesi. people are after something that is nice-looking and together with that there is the entertainment side. this year music will have a part to play in this. the market for full-track music downloads was worth just $ million (£. million) in but is set to be worth $. billion (£ million) by according to juniper research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone the which combines a digital music player with up to hours battery life and a two megapixel camera. in july last year motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life.

366,mobile multimedia slow to catch on there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular. consumers swapping old phones for slinkier dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a % increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of according to analysts gartner more than million handsets were sold globally between july and september a period that according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is seldom strong . but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps sounds and video clips few so far are taking the chance to do so. in fact the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures audio and video is growing. figures gathered by continental research shows that % of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (mms) up from % in . this is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to . million. getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying. the problem they face said shailendra jain head of mms firm adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets. also he said they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it. research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to. according to continental research % of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation. only % regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people s reluctance to start sending them said mr jain. they ask themselves: if i m streaming video from one handset to another will it work he said. there s a lot of user apprehension about that. there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might. andrew bud executive chairman of messaging firm mblox said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system. the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant he said. the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users. no-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped said mr bud. this has led to operators finding other technologies particularly one known as wap-push to get multimedia to their customers. but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers the results can be dramatic. israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth. one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india the largest mobile firm in the country. the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. while not multimedia messaging such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content. as a result % of the subscribers to the hutch alive which uses celltick s broadcast technology regularly click for more pictures sounds and images from the operator. operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers said yaron toren spokesman for celltick. until then multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.

1942,yukos accused of lying to court russian oil firm yukos lied to a us court in an attempt to stop the russian government selling off its key production unit the court has heard. the unit yugansk was sold to pay off a $. (£.) back tax bill. yukos argued that since it had a us subsidiary and local bank accounts the us court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of yugansk. but deutsche bank - itself a target of a yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case. deutsche bank s evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in houston. its lawyer hugh ray told the court that yukos had claimed it had transferred $ into two texas bank accounts opened by its new us subsidiary. by doing so he said the firm had intended to reinforce its us presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in us courts. but he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after yukos made its bankruptcy application on december and then backdated. yukos chief financial officer bruce misamore who had moved to the us in early december to set up yukos usa acknowledged the point. he said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork but that money had indeed been transferred on december. even so he told the court that only $ had been in the accounts that day with the rest arriving a day later. deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos. it had agreed to loan to an arm of russian state gas firm gazprom the money to bid for yuganskneftegaz as the yukos unit is formally known. the sale went ahead despite an order from the us bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. in the end the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $. - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm rosneft. rosneft meanwhile has agreed to merge with gazprom bringing a large chunk of russia s very profitable oil business back under state control. yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the us because it feared it would not be able to do so in russia. it also said that in the event of going bust it could offer the chance of restructuring. it gives us a kind of life after death alternative said yukos chief executive steven theede. yukos is currently suing four companies - gazprom its unit gazpromneft rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding - for their part in yugansk s disposal. it has also threatened to sue the russian government for $. analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies while moscow officials have dismissed yukos legal wrangling as meaningless. yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky once russia s richest man is in prison having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.
2167,no re-draft for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps. the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms. the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review all aspects of the directive . the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words computer implemented invention . in a letter ec president jos& manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament josep borrell that the commission did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council (of ministers) as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may . if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament. but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law. french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament s request it would be an insult to the assembly. he said that the parliament would then reject the council s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its one-click shopping service for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.
2076,looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts gartner. more than million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date. the figure was % more than in and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to gartner that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales. all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website. japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years time. they already have tv music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones. but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too according to gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said gartner. third generation mobiles () with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. at the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical. nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms. more likely to drive sales in would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services. the motorola razr phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in she added. this was not a women s thing she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner. western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design said ms milanesi. people are after something that is nice-looking and together with that there is the entertainment side. this year music will have a part to play in this. the market for full-track music downloads was worth just $ million (£. million) in but is set to be worth $. billion (£. million) by according to jupiter research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone the which combines a digital music player with up to hours battery life and a two megapixel camera. in july last year motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life.
1904,no half measures with half-life could half-life possibly live up to the hype after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it s safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time. fortunately it doesn t merely live up to its promise but exceeds it. no-one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long. the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped. all the money - or indeed time - is on the screen. the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original half-life. having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility he s back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic city . it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city but as soon as your train pulls in to the station it s clear that all is not well here. sinister police patrol the unkempt streets and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be. you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. it is not immediately explained what your objectives are nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. that does not really matter. does not waste energy blinding you with plot. underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective and immerses the player in the most vivid convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. there are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow. exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you. whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride wandering through half-life s world truly does feel like being part of a movie. considering its sophistication the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc s components this is it. on our test machine - an alienware system with an athlon + processor and ati s radeon video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping. it is not simply that the surfaces textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. the haunting grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. so impressive are the physics that you ll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. there are puzzles to be solved along the way pitched at about the right difficulty but most progress is achieved by force. freeman is quickly reunited with the original game s famous crowbar and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow. virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with and in realistic fashion. you will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls chase a pigeon out of your way or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. at times half-life feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to and in a curious way its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. running around on foot is great enough but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. in gameplay terms somehow gets almost everything perfect. and without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of doom iii it s all incredibly unsettling. the vacant environment is distinctly eerie and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside. the game does have a couple of problems. firstly the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people. a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue which makes for exciting moments but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you ve completed it. if you like things open-ended and free-ranging far cry will be a lot more pleasing. but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint s patience. developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. the box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed the temperamental valve servers and the time of day but it can take hours. it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily half-life is up to the challenge. it is surely the best thing in its genre and possibly many will feel of any genre. the bar has been raised and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future. half-life is out now for the pc

1271,germany nears jobless level german unemployment rose for the consecutive month in december - making the year s average jobless total the highest since reunification. the seasonally adjusted jobless total rose a higher than expected to . million the bundesbank said. allowing for changes in calculating statistics the average number of people out of work was the highest since - or a rate of .%. bad weather and a sluggish economy were blamed for the rise. the increase was due primarily to the onstart of winter labour office chief frank-juergen weise said. unadjusted the figures showed unemployment rose to . million - with many sectors such as construction laying off workers amid bad weather. the three years of stagnation in the german economy came to an end in . but the upturn is still not strong enough to boost the labour market mr weise added. news of the rise came as government welfare reforms came into force a move that is expected to see unemployment swell still further in coming months. under the hartz iv changes the previous two tier system of benefits and support for the long term unemployed has been replaced with one flat-rate payout. in turn that means more people will be classified as looking for work driving official figures higher. be prepared for a nasty figure for january about five million unemployed on a non-seasonally adjusted basis warned hvb group economist andreas rees. but he did add that the numbers should subside throughout the year to remain near s level of . million jobless. i don t expect a strong and lasting turnaround until german economy minister wolfgang clement said. by however the hartz iv reforms should help cut the average jobless rate to between % and % he added. europe s biggest economy has been too weak to create work as it struggles to shake off three years of economic stagnation. in recent months companies such as adam opel - the german arm of us carmaker general motors - and retailer karstadtquelle have slashed jobs.

1464,bmw cash to fuel mini production less than four years after the new mini was launched german car maker bmw has announced £ of new investment. some new jobs are to be created at the oxford factory including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. the result of the investment could be to raise output to more than cars from . the rise from last year is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. before wednesday s announcement bmw had invested some £ in mini production. since its launch during summer the new mini has gone from strength to strength. last year almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini. the company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away said norbert reithofer a member of the bmw management board. initially bmw said it would produce mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford but the target was quickly reached then raised time and time again. not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. the risk is that after they ve invested massively in the brand demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle said brad wernle from automotive news europe. the price of the car has also gone up. when it was launched the cheapest mini cost just more than £ . these days buyers will have to fork out almost £ to own a new mini one or even more for the cooper s which costs up to £ . the mini convertible which was launched last spring costs up to £ for the top model and there is even a waiting list. second-hand minis are not cheap either. a mini one bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least £ for the cheapest model while a used cooper s is likely to be priced from £ according to the-car buying website parker s. the consumers association which operates with slightly different numbers yet it confirms that the mini cooper . depreciates slower than any other car other than the mercedes benz se and the bmw series se. the cowley factory which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just minis is increasingly being put to good use. there are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. bmw s mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for £ five years ago to the phoenix consortium. in when bmw still owned rover the oxford factory was producing the award-winning rover . during that year people produced cars. last year in the same factory almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just mini-workers. the mini factory s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge which in produced rover cars. last year mg rover which employs more than people produced just cars though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation (saic) that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge. indeed mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers (which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford) are taken into account.

838,spain coach faces racism inquiry spain s football federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach luis aragones over racist comments about thierry henry. if found guilty aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about £ . the federation had initially declined to take action against aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in october. but its president angel maria villar changed his mind after a request by spain s anti-violence commission. aragones insisted the comments made to henry s arsenal club-mate jose antonio reyes were meant to motivate the player and were not intended to be offensive. i never intended to offend anyone and for that reason i have a very easy conscience he said at the time. i m obliged to motivate my players to get the best results. as part of that job i use colloquial language with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world. england s players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against spain in madrid last month. but the storm increased following racist chanting by spanish fans at england s black players during the game which spain won -. spain s minister of sport jaime lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the federation s decision. everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations and make sure they do not give a negative image he said. we are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism.
259,podcasters look to net money nasa is doing it -year-old boys in bedrooms are doing it couples are doing it gadget lovers - male and female - are definitely doing it. it is podcasting - diy radio in the form of downloadable audio files. they can done by anyone who has a microphone simple software the net and something to say. some liken them to talking audioblogs because many complement text-based weblogs - diary-like sites where people share their thoughts. they are essentially amateur radio shows on the net on demand and the movement is at very early stages. it s about real people saying real things and communicating says adam curry former mtv vj and the pied piper of podcasting. he was one of a community of people who created ipodder a small computer program known as an aggregator . it collects and automatically sends files to any digital music-playing device that can play wmp formats. those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like and subscribe - for free - to that show s feed . when a new podcast is available it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer. it is totally going to kill the business model of radio thinks curry. i just did a tour of madison avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are he says. and they are scared to death of the next generation - like my daughter who is - who don t listen to radio. they are on msn they ve got their ipod their player they ve got their xbox - they are not listening to radio. so how are they going to reach these audiences it is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it. it is a fledgling movement but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it. ian fogg jupiter research analyst thinks there could be potential for business but it could take an interesting turn if big companies like apple and microsoft get involved. it is a nascent area but quite exciting. it is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over he says. podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about - a classic hybrid. it is another aspect of the time-shifting of content - the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want when and wherever you want. audiences are in the and rather than millions. more than podcasts are currently listed. curry s daily source code - which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community - has of thousands of listeners. but dave winer is doubtful. he designed the format called rss (really simple syndication) which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like. podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed. he is also writer of the longest-running weblog on the net scripting news. he thinks its power lies in its democratising potential not in its over-hyped business promise. we re the sources the people doing stuff and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we re doing. no matter how you look at it commercialising this medium isn t going to make very much money he says. podcasting is going to be a medium of niches with audiences measured in the single digits like e-mail or blogs. maybe in a few years maybe six or seven digits. but it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon. curry and associate ron bloom s new venture called podshow is to help ordinary people produce post distribute and market their podcasts. because of the way podcasts work based on rss the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready-made targets. when you look at podcasting - wow this is a pretty interesting audience. the audience is pre-selected. they have decided to subscribe to your program explains curry. advertising in his eyes can be tailored to podcasts to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive. how i believe this will work is to create a network that in aggregation will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters. i have listeners. i could make a couple of bucks off that but not much. if you are talking a million podcasters and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves then that is kind of interesting. essentially he says if you are doing a bass fishing podcast someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show. he is clear the ads will not be the traditional in-your-face type familiar to commercial radio now. we are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place. it is happening already. coffee-loving curry has sold $ worth of coffee machines through a referral link to amazon from his site. others use in-show promotions like the dawn and drew show. one eric rice has won sponsorship from warner bros. he can now legally play the music of a band warner bros wants to push. some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days. others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative. one thing is for sure; they are not about to disappear in a hurry. the creative forces behind radio are elated says curry. for now he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community. i should be knighted for this he adds with a wry chuckle people are going to be so happy to sit at home make their podcast and make a little money.
414,brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other. this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government s global aid and debt initiatives particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. it dominated the prime minister s monthly news conference which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. as he told journalists: i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. there is a complete unity of purpose. and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election. so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown s long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt he was asked by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. well not really as it happens. and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. although in the next breath he declared: i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers before catching himself on and quickly adding: in so far as i read them of course. he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men. as far as the timing of the prime minister s press conference is concerned there are two options. the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous downing street grid - to avert just such allegations. either way the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. firstly the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government s response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt. then as if to pour fuel on the flames both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott - without mentioning the other. all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had as a result started to set out his own platform. the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed should be in the manifesto has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister s turf - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. the prime minister denied all that as well repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.
938,umaga ready for fearsome lions all blacks captain tama umaga has warned the british and irish lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour. but umaga in england for saturday s irb rugby aid match also backed new zealand to win the three-test series against the lions. he told bbc sport: it s potentially the most fearsome line-up i ve ever come up against. they re awesome. but i d back us all the way to beat them when they come over. lions boss sir clive woodward is set to announce his squad for the june-july tour next month. when woodward was appointed last year it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former england players. but umaga said: he d be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the six nations. don t get me wrong england have got a lot of talented guys and i m sure there are some of them who ll make the lions test xv. but you can t disguise wales and ireland in particular. some of the tries they ve scored have been great. i ll admit it ll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of brian o driscoll. umaga will meet o driscoll in saturday s rugby aid match at twickenham with the irish captain leading the northern hemisphere side. o driscoll is among a host of players in the northern hemisphere squad coached by woodward that are tipped for lions call-ups. it ll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys although a lot can change between now and june umaga said. the -year-old admitted interest in the lions tour was immense calling it the biggest thing to hit new zealand since lord of the rings . he added: as players it s enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the lions. in fact it s not just us all blacks - it s the talk of the country. umaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of saturday s charity game which features a host of big names including george gregan andrew mehrtens and chris latham. but he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. the second [southern hemisphere coach] rod macqueen made the approach i didn t hesitate. it was great when new zealand rugby then gave me the all clear. thankfully i didn t know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn t miss all the horrific reports on the news. there are so many people that were affected are still affected and will be affected for a long time. it s just good to know we can do something minor to help out. - the match will be televised on bbc one at gmt on saturday.
953,hollywood hunts hits at sundance the sundance film festival the movie industry s top destination for uncovering the next independent hits and new talent opens on thursday. the event will see screen executives decamp from hollywood to park city utah for days to search for low-key movies that could make it big in . open water napoleon dynamite garden state and super-size me were all snapped up at last year s festival. but stars like keanu reeves and pierce brosnan also have films showing there. the festival is being opened by a screening of quirky comedy happy endings starring former friends actress lisa kudrow and maggie gyllenhaal on thursday. kudrow s friends co-star david schwimmer plays a divorced drunkard in duane hopwood while brosnan stars as a hit man in comedy the matador. keanu reeves appears in coming-of-age tale thumbsucker while kevin costner and michael keaton are among the other big names whose films are involved. robert redford founded sundance in and it has gone on to showcase future successes such as reservoir dogs the blair witch project and the full monty. but it has received criticism that it has become more commercial and mainstream over the years. as much as the press argues that sundance has completely changed it hasn t changed that much festival director geoffrey gilmore said. it s still a place for discovery. it s a place for common ground among film-makers and audiences more than it is the celebrity stuff. other films generating interest before this year s festival include hustle & flow about an aspiring rapper the squid and the whale an autobiographical film by writer-director noah baumbach and comedy/drama pretty persuasion. it also has two new international cinema competitions.
1729,us prepares for hybrid onslaught sales of hybrid cars in the us are set to double in research suggests. research group jd power estimates sales will hit in despite higher prices and customer scepticism. carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (suvs) the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the us car market. hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. several jurisdictions notably the state of california mandate low emissions for new cars. equally the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a year on fuel. at the detroit motor show a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. toyota has led the market to date with the prius popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their green credentials. in april it will launch a hybrid version of its highlander suv with an suv from its luxury lexus marque due later in the year. honda has three hybrids on the market and between them the two japanese carmakers sold more than units last year. ford which has sold of its first hybrid since its launch in august is bringing a hybrid suv - the mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule with plans for three more models by . gm has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept suvs in detroit. even sports car maker porsche may join the race although it insists it is still considering whether to hybridise its cayenne suv. others remain more sceptical. nissan has bought toyota s hybrid technology but plans to bring out its first model only in . we want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology nissan chief executive carlos ghosn said. we will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market. volkswagen meanwhile says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. and some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $ above that of an equivalent normal-engined car and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction. the average consumers aren t willing to pay that premium for a car they won t drive more than six years said anthony pratt from jd power.
73,funding cut hits wales students the wales students rugby side has become a casualty of the welsh rugby union s reorganisation at youth level. an amalgamated under- side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on thursday against italy at the gnoll. but that move has seen the wru decide to end its funding of representative sides such as wales students. as a result traditional international fixtures against england and france in the new year have been cancelled. the welsh students rugby football union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches. the secretary of the welsh students rugby football union reverend eldon phillips said: it is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year. the competition provided by the strong english and french teams has enabled the welsh students to test themselves in high quality matches. the increasing number of young rugby players entering higher education look for the biggest challenge that is representative rugby but this year that opportunity will be denied them. players who have played for wales students before going on to win full senior representative honours include robert jones rob howley jon humphreys darren morris martyn williams and ceri sweeney.
779,cuba winds back economic clock fidel castro s decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba s ailing economy. all conversions between the us dollar and cuba s convertible peso will from november be subject to a % tax. cuban citizens who receive money from overseas and foreign visitors who change dollars in cuba will be affected. critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards reflecting the cuban president s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. in a live television broadcast announcing the measure president castro s chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states increasing economic aggression . the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country he said. the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months. president bush s government which has been a strong supporter of the -year-old trade embargo on cuba introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may. cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives. a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture. i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash says jose barrionuevo head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital. it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue. the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home. this money known as remittances can amount to as much as $ a year. those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax. their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax such as euros or increase their dollar payments to compensate. however many of cuban s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result. the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there. cuba s tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and according to the un economic commission for latin america is now worth $ to the country. the tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for cuba s cash-strapped economy. cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food fuel and medicine. much of cuba s basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. in recent weeks cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island. cuba s economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid as the collapse of the soviet union forced it to embrace foreign capital decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise. however a decline in foreign tourism since periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy. it has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government s economic problems. the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading mr barrionuevo said. the main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries like venezuela which have restrictions on capital he says. mr barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity. it is intended to be a permanent measure but i am not sure it can last too long.
654,asylum children to face returns the uk government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to albania. the trial scheme which could start in weeks may be extended to apply to children from other countries. children s charities have reacted with alarm saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. but the home office says it may be in the children s best interests if it reunites them with their communities. the pilot included in the government s five-year immigration plan aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims. since at least under- have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members. these children automatically become the responsibility of social services. up to now ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at . at least a dozen albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return according to sources although there is no public confirmation of numbers. those selected could either be returned to their families should they be traced or placed in the care of other albanian authorities. separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country. under the children act public bodies have a duty to act in the best interest of a child in their care. laura brownlees of save the children said there were grave concerns not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in albania. if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis she said. we do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in albania]. if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision. in its five-year immigration plan announced on tuesday the government said it was addressing the difficult issue of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children and leave them to rot . we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused said the spokesman. we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it s possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable. we do not believe that it is right or in keeping with children s legislation that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities. the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations. only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned he said. but andrew hogg spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies. from what is so far known we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account said mr hogg. in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. the medical foundation has many serious concerns including the assessment process for suitability for return the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries. a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.
1085,sluggish economy hits german jobs the number of people out of work in europe s largest economy has risen for the tenth straight month as growth remains stubbornly slow. german unemployment rose in november to . million people or .% of the workforce. the seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect. but officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market. there are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand said frank-juergen weise head of the federal labour agency in a statement. but growth of .%... in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market. high oil prices and the soaring euro - which damages the competitiveness of exporters - were also having a negative effect he said. the brunt of the unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of germany where the rate is .%. with unemployment stuck above million for years the government of chancellor gerhard schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda. a controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work paid for by cutting some cherished benefits has sparked anger among some german workers. strikes in a number of industries notably among the country s iconic carmakers have demonstrated the displeasure - as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold. among the new initiatives are the so-called one-euro jobs which top up unemployment benefit. the scheme s formal launch is january but hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting the unemployment statistics economists said. the deterioration of the labour market does not come as a surprise said isabelle kronawitter at hypovereinsbank. job creation measures probably prevented a stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers.
472,anti-terror plan faces first test plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament. tories lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans. mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. opponents say only judges not politicians should be able to order detention of uk citizens. the government is expected to win wednesday s vote in the commons but faces a battle in the house of lords. the prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday. it proposes control orders which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases and curfews electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects. the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary rather than a judge. tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice like the guildford four - for which tony blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects. those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that s why we have serious concerns abut that approach he told bbc radio s today programme. mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the current terror detainees. he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at london s belmarsh prison. they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on march. the new powers designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords concerns would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects. critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for years. opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days - wednesday and next monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords. but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently. in a rare move the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill saying the house arrest plans are excessive . it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan wrongly infringes the right to liberty by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. mr davis told today: it gives a minister for the first time in modern history the right to detain without trial without showing the evidence and indeed in some respects almost the allegation against the individual concerned. he questioned why there was such a rush to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions not politicians. mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be rash and negligent to ignore their advice. nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the uk and its interests he argued.
920,oscar nominees lack pulling power this year s clutch of oscar nominees have been the least popular for years according to box office figures. in the us the five nominated for best film have been seen by % fewer people than movies in previous years. while the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony. we don t have a titanic or a lord of the rings out there. i think it s fair to say it does concern us a bit said academy executive director bruce davis. about million people in the us have seen this year s nominees compared with between million and million in recent years. the last time combined attendance was so low was in when amadeus beat the killing fields a passage to india places in the heart and a soldier s story to best picture when million saw the five films. last year s ceremony attracted the highest audience in four years as viewers tuned in to see lord of the ring: return of the king sweep the board. and the show reaped its biggest audience in when titanic took home oscars. the film had taken $ (£) worldwide before the ceremony and eventually took $. (£). eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the tv screen said paul dergarabedian of box office tracker exhibitor relations. people like to have a vested interest in what they re watching. when titanic does $. in worldwide box office you ve got a lot of people with a vested interest. past years have also seen blockbusters such as saving private ryan forrest gump and ghost compete for oscars. the biggest box office hitter among this year s nominees is the aviator which has taken $ (£) in the us although takings in the uk have reached only £ so far. low-budget move sideways and finding neverland have so far grossed about $ (£) each. the year s biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the oscar nominees but in the animation category. shrek and the incredibles took $ (£) while the incredibles took $ (£). mel gibson s the passion of the christ which took $ (£) in the us was largely ignored by academy voters. but many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success. i have never equated the academy awards with how much money a movie takes in said nikki rocco head of distribution at universal which released nominee ray. that s the people s choice awards. this is not about the public. this is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year.
1296,clarke to press on with id cards new home secretary charles clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for id cards despite a call for him to pause for thought from charles kennedy. the lib dem leader said david blunkett s resignation was a good opportunity to question whether the legislation was necessary. but mr clarke said he had supported the plans when mr blunkett argued for them in cabinet and he supported them now. id cards are a means to creating a more secure society he said. mr clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been significantly influenced by the recommendations of the commons home affairs committee. the issue would be debated in parliament next monday as scheduled he insisted. earlier mr kennedy whose party opposes the id cards plan as deeply flawed said with christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. he told bbc radio s today programme that mr clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about id cards than his predecessors. wouldn t this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary a new broom to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place he asked. earlier this week the tories announced they would back the government s plans although michael howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision. they had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror crime and illegal immigration. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis oliver letwin and tim yeo. the chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc has warned there is a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists. what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained. the home office says people will pay £ for a passport and id card together or a undecided fee for a separate id card. the first cards would be issued in and when he was introducing the bill mr blunkett suggested parliament could decide in or whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards although not to carry them. the new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents. and there will be civil penalties including a fine of up to £ fine for people who fail to say they have moved house or changed other details and of up to £ for failing to sign up if the cards become compulsory. the scheme will be overseen by a new independent watchdog.

1680,europe asks asia for euro help european leaders say asian states must let their currencies rise against the us dollar to ease pressure on the euro. the european single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. tacit approval from the white house for the weaker greenback which could help counteract huge deficits has helped trigger the move. but now europe says the euro has had enough and asia must now share some of the burden. china is seen as the main culprit with exports soaring up % in partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. asia should engage in greater currency flexibility said french finance minister herve gaymard after a meeting with his german counterpart hans eichel. markets responded by pushing the euro lower in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the industrialised countries next week. early on tuesday morning the dollar had edged higher to . euros. the yen meanwhile had strengthened to . against the dollar by gmt.
1456,french wine gets euro top-up the french government is to hand its struggling wine industry euros ($) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction. the financial package is aimed at assisting vintners in financial trouble and improving how its wine is marketed. the french wine industry the world s second largest has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of new world wines. wine makers however claimed the support did not go far enough. the package was announced by agriculture minister dominique bussereau after talks with vintners representatives. the bulk of the money - about euros - will be offered in the form of preferential loans to heavily indebted producers to enable them to reschedule their payments. a further euros will be made available to wine cooperatives which make up the majority of french producers in low interest loans. efforts to promote french wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra . euros in funding. france fell behind the new world producers of australia chile and the united states for the first time in in terms of exports. domestic consumption accounting for % of sales has suffered from strict restrictions on advertising and tough drink-driving laws. the aid package would create a positive climate around french viticulture mr bussereau said. however wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for. i am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions jean-michel lemetayer from the fnsea agricultural union told the associated press news agency. in an effort to tackle overcapacity the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent while vintners will be helped to take early retirement. the government will also seek european union approval to distil about million litres of excess wine into alcohol with vintners receiving compensation. production is currently outstripping demand by about %. the support is designed to make french producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry. wine makers in france s best-known regions such as burgundy have found it hard to invest in new technology and to create recognisable brands to appeal to overseas buyers.

353,pearce keen on succeeding keegan joint assistant boss stuart pearce has admitted he would like to succeed kevin keegan as manager at manchester city. keegan has decided to step down as city manager when his contract comes to an end in months. you don t have to be einstein to realise there will be a manager s job available at a really good club pearce told bbc gmr. i will certainly be applying for it although whether the board deem me good enough to take it i do not know. pearce initially joined city as a player under keegan in before becoming part of the coaching staff. he was promoted to joint assistant-manager following the departure of arthur cox last summer. the former england defender had a year as player-boss with nottingham forest eight seasons ago but has made no secret of his desire to have another crack at the job. he was linked with the manager s job at oldham and keegan has stated he would not get in the way if pearce wanted to leave. but it now appears pearce is keen to wait for his chance at city. he added: by that time i will have been here for five years so at least they will have had a good look at me and they are aware of my feelings with regard to being kevin s successor. obviously the issue is out of my hands but it is a fantastic job for anybody - i just hope it will be me.
1337,big war games battle it out the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice. the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats building on many of the original s elements. for its part the long-running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue adapting the console game rising sun. call of duty: finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war battlefronts including russia and north africa. it is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you. on a near-identical note medal of honor: pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action. its arenas are the war s pacific battles including guadalcanal and pearl harbour. you play one character throughout a raw and rather talkative us soldier. both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along. when this works it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story. when it does not it is tedious. a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii. you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman before seizing the anti-aircraft guns. it is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game. this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic. the genius of something like half life is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection. this pair of games do not really accomplish that being more concerned with imparting a full-on atmospheric experience. call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation. finest hour has a similar determination framing everything in moody wartime music archive footage and lots of reflective voice-overs. letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat. the game s drawback could be said to be its format; tastes differ but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc. the mouse control is a big reason why along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety. call of duty on pc was more detailed plot-wise and graphically and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready. targeting with the controller proved tricky not helped by unconvincing collision-detection. you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him. checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot which happens regularly you are set harshly far back and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again. the game wants to be a challenge and is and many players will like it for that. it is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive. both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour. and in pacific assault in particular their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless. but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all. of the two games pacific assault gets more things right including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation. it engages you very well and also looks wonderful making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry although we had to ramp up the settings on a high-spec machine to get the most out of them. finest hour is by no means bad and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming. those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented. but they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent.
675,kilroy launches veritas party ex-bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy-silk has said he wants to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party. mr kilroy-silk who recently quit the uk independence party said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration. he told a london news conference that veritas - latin for truth - would avoid the old parties lies and spin . ukip leader roger knapman says he was glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk. mr kilroy-silk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks. and he announced the party would be holding a leadership election. on thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon s ashfield seat. he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip s two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader. ukip s chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. mr kilroy-silk announced his decision to quit ukip at a public meeting in hinckley leicestershire last week. it came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june s european elections. while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said. i will be standing at the next general election. i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in. and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight. mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy-silk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party. a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly. the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down. its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk. he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the [european] election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said. ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead. this is just what the europhiles pray for. as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe. having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further. thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone - now ukip at least has a chance in the election! it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip. robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer. instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation. last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk. it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting. ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu. this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk. if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another. so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow! interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name! every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country. kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities. recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come! well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party. it s all flash and no real policy here let s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity. veritas the name will doom it. but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that

537,santy worm makes unwelcome visit thousands of website bulletin boards have been defaced by a virus that used google to spread across the net. the santy worm first appeared on december and within hours had successfully hit more than websites. the malicious program exploits a vulnerability in the widely used phpbb software. santy s spread has now been stopped after google began blocking infected sites searching for new victims. the worm replaces chat forums with a webpage announcing that the site had been defaced by the malicious program. soon after being infected sites hit by the worm started randomly searching for other websites running the vulnerable phpbb software. once google started blocking these search queries the rate of infection tailed off sharply. a message sent to finnish security firm f-secure by google s security team said: while a seven hour response for something like this is not outrageous we think we can and should do better. we will be reviewing our procedures to improve our response time in the future to similar problems the google team said. security firms estimate that about websites run their discussion groups and forums with the open source phpbb program. the worst of the attack now seems to be over as a search conducted on the morning of the december produced only hits for sites showing the text used in the defacement message. people using the sites hit by santy will not be affected by the worm. santy is not the first malicious program to use google to help it spread. in july a variant of the mydoom virus slowed down searches on google as the program flooded the search site with queries looking for new e-mail addresses to send itself to.

1333,cebit opens to mobile music tune cebit the world s largest hi-tech fair has opened its doors in hanover for a look at the latest technologies for homes and businesses. there are more than exhibitors registered and about visitors are expected to pass through the doors. third generation mobiles the digital home and broadband are key themes at the show. camera phones will get better resolutions as vendors set out to prove that bigger is definitely better. samsung is set to steal some initial limelight with the launch of a -megapixel phone on the opening day. the sch- has some of the features of high-end digital single lens reflex cameras such as manual focus and the ability to attach a telephoto or wide-angle lens. camera phones are likely to prove an interesting battle ground at the show said ben wood principal analyst at research firm gartner. it is firmly established that cameras are an integral part of phones and now the technology arms race is on in terms of megapixels. there will be a certain amount of look how big mine is he said. there will also be increasing focus on music-enabled mobiles. at in cannes everyone went music mad and music is going to be a big theme for all the vendors at cebit said mr wood. sony ericsson will use the fair to show off the - its recently unveiled walkman branded phone - and there is speculation that motorola may unveil its rokr handset widely tipped as the first to carry apple s itunes music software. apple and motorola announced they were getting together at the end of last year as a result of a long-standing friendship between motorola s chief executive ed zander and steve jobs. some analysts think motorola may save the launch for ctia a wireless show in america the following week which could be a telling sign about how operators are coming to view the german tech fair. one of the interesting things is that cebit is clearly a show in decline said mr wood. a lot of the big players such as nokia are pulling back saying it is hard to justify a big presence at all of the shows. it could be the last big year for cebit he said. other themes include tv-enabled mobiles which are bound to create a buzz in the halls as vodafone unveils a prototype handset that can show live digital television. there has been a glut of recent headlines about mobile tv - french operators are teaming up is trialling a system in oxford uk and nokia begins trialling a system in finland with the finnish broadcasting company yle tv and commercial tv channels. cebit could become the battleground for the two competing methods for getting tv on to mobiles and is also likely to provide a stage for a technology slated to compete with . hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access) has been described as on steroids and could offer consumers much faster download times. for instance a song which currently takes one and a half minutes to download to a phone could be done in seconds. korean giants lg electronics and samsung will show off hsdpa handsets at the show and the technology is set to be rolled out in the us europe and korea next year. broadband will continue to be a key theme at the show with internet telephony proving this year s killer application. germany s largest online service provider t-online is tipped to reveal software for low-cost net telephony which would see it competing with its parent company deutsche telekom. cebit is used by many to unveil cutting edge products and in the mobile sphere this is likely to mean a lot of bright colourful handsets as fashion continues to compete with technology when it comes to the device everyone has in their pockets. rainbow-coloured phones influenced by handsets from japan are just one example of how asian companies will stamp their mark on this year s show at which they will have their biggest ever presence. cebit organisers have created a digital home in hall of the hangar-like buildings that will house the show. the digital home will be a hyped theme at the show. the house will be totally wired and full of things that can be used for home entertainment said cebit organiser gabriele dorries.
1369,anelka eyes man city departure striker nicolas anelka reportedly wants to leave manchester city in search of champions league football. anelka is in talks over a contract extension beyond with city but is believed to fear his career will go stale if he stays at the club. the news of the world reports that anelka told a french magazine: i either decide to win titles or to have an easy life. i think i will always choose football if a great club makes me an offer. he added: to win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so. if we stagnate between eighth and place it s impossible to progress. if i am going to score goals and not win there is a risk it is going to create a feeling of being fed up. anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at arsenal real madrid and paris st germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him. i am in talks to sign an extension to my contract he said. i am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account. playing for eighth place is good but i miss the champions league. i won it with real madrid in and i need to be playing in it - and i should be playing in it. i m not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football. but i don t blame anyone. it s a bit my fault.
2160,peer-to-peer nets here to stay peer-to-peer () networks are here to stay and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms says a panel of industry experts. once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year firms will be very keen to try and make money from technology. the expert panel probed the future of at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january. the first convictions for piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software. since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of technology blaming it for falling sales and piracy. but that is going to change very soon according to the panel. the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. but they have slowly realised that is a good way to distribute content said travis kalanick founder and chairman of network red swoosh and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. they are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards. but until the legal actions are resolved experimentation with cannot not happen said michael weiss president of streamcast networks. remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out mr weiss said: old media always tries to stop new media. when they can t stop it they try to control it. then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money. once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. in august the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast two file-sharing networks. the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the vcr battle and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal. networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. there are now many different types of systems than work in different ways. nets can be used to share any kind of file like photos free software licensed music and any other digital content. the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology. it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use technology to distribute them. the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. the global entertainment industry says more than . billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month and about half a million films are downloaded a day. legal music download services like apple itunes napster have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in with million tracks bought online in the us and europe in months the ifpi reported this week. but such download services are very different from networks not least because of the financial aspect. there are several money-spinning models that could turn into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. paid-for-pass-along in which firms receive money each time a file is shared along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered. we see there are going to be different models for commoditising said marc morgenstern vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer. consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together agreed mr morgenstern. but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry s potential controlling grip on content and technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. unsigned bands for example use networks to distribute their music effectively which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign. increasingly what you are seeing on is consumer-created content said derek broes from microsoft. they will probably play an increasing role in helping spread he said. looking into s future file sharing is just the beginning for networks as far as mr broes is concerned. once some of these issues are resolved you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content but also in ways that are unimaginable now he said. file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.
149,the future in your pocket if you are a geek or gadget fan the next months look like they are going to be a lot of fun. the relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors particularly among mobile phone firms all suggests that is going to be a very good year. to begin with will be the year that third-generation () mobile phones become inescapable. the network launched in vodafone launched its consumer service in november orange followed in early december and t-mobile and are due to launch in . the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up. already the extra capacity in networks lets offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue. show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them and i ll write their obituary said niel ransom chief technology officer at alcatel. instead operators are likely to push all other things that phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. but will not have everything its own way. it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax. this wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to megabits per second and works over distances of up to miles. kent is likely to be the site of the uk s first wimax network which is due to go live in and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. analyst firm telecom view predicts that wimax will steal a lot of market share from and will be a clear winner. bob larribeau principal analyst at telecom view said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of networks. and the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. the technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers. moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in too. for a start bt looks set to roll out its bluephone project during the next months. the service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip (voip). voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. anyone with a broadband connection which is now more than % of the uk s net using population can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared to be the area code for voip calls and is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused voip call services starting up. home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. if has been the year of the portable music player they looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. motorola has just announced a deal with apple to produce a phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. the pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. the only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. but that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with.

1011,making your office work for you our mission to brighten up your working lives continues - and this time we re taking a long hard look at your offices. over the next few months our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient more congenial or simply prettier. this week we re hearing from marianne petersen who is planning to convert a barn in sweden into a base for her freelance writing work. click on the link under her photograph to read her story and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say. and if you want to take part in the series go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch. working from home presents a multitude of challenges. understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style. do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done do you build on the ideas of others - or are you a more introspective problem solver . in order for a virtual office to succeed keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential. it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit and to keep strict office hours. referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space. it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network. isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry. joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like-minded people may assist. it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy - with the danger that when the workload eases they have to be resurrected. prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight and the structure is checked for stability. it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing. ideally the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn. this would also allow for a well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured. it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity. in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate. ideally it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities. the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed and the walls should be painted in a light colour. the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks; this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface. i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn. as for lighting consider a combination of floor mounted uplights wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights. use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior. please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for marianne s barn. the layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space. large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available. the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace. regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house your plan of going wireless is sensible. a wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient. however important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass which could result in a weak signal strength. you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area. your local it supplier will be able to advise on this. if you haven t already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software it is essential to do so to protect your investment. to really take advantage of wireless technology you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor. or you could use one of the new tablet computers which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built-in hand recognition software. and finally you will save money and space by considering a multi-function product for print scan copy and fax.
2178,hollywood ready for oscars night hollywood is preparing for the biggest night in the film world s calendar the academy awards on sunday. a host of stars are expected to grace the red carpet outside los angeles kodak theatre including johnny depp cate blanchett and leonardo dicaprio. british actors in attendance include nominees clive owen imelda staunton kate winslet and director mike leigh. the aviator leads the shortlist but critics believe the night may belong to clint eastwood s million dollar baby. a recent poll of us pundits found eastwood s boxing drama had become the new favourite to win best film over the howard hughes biopic. if the -year-old does win he will become the oldest person ever to be named best director at the ceremony. uk critics still favour the aviator for best film but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between eastwood and martin scorsese. scorsese has never won the best director prize despite four previous nominations for films including raging bull goodfellas and gangs of new york. eastwood has won best director once before for unforgiven in . most experts predict the twice-nominated jamie foxx will win best actor for his portrayal of singer ray charles while vera drake star imelda staunton looks likely to lose out in the best actress field to hilary swank in million dollar baby. the uk s highest hopes remain with clive owen who has scooped both the golden globe and the bafta for his supporting role in closer. actor and comedian chris rock will host the event which will be broadcast with a seven-second time delay to allow censors to cut out any unsuitable content. we have the bleep machine ready but bleeps will be used as needed producer gil cates told reporters. however he added that he strongly disapproved of the growing tendency to censor live broadcasts on us tv. he also played down fears that rock who is known for using strong language in his stand-up routines might cause controversy on the night. the -year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show. chris has a sense of humour and everything he says is really said humorously cates said. you need a movie star and someone who is a stand-up comic so they can deal with the vicissitudes of the show. security will also be tight with police employing a system to detect sarin nerve gas. we are pulling out all the stops said john miller chief of counterterrorism at the los angeles police department. the show is a symbol of american culture and has the potential to be a high-visibility target he added. meanwhile organisers have erected a canopy over the red carpet following an outbreak of torrential rain in los angeles over the past week. cates said the covers would be removed if the threat of wet weather receded. details have also emerged of the contents of this year s gift bags which are given to nominees and presenters on the night. this year s bags will include a gift certificate for a luxury beach resort a pair of mink eyelashes and a kitchen set with a year s supply of tea and coffee. the event will be televised by the abc network from local time ( gmt) and on sky movies in the uk from gmt.
343,blair returns from peace mission prime minister tony blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the middle east to try to resurrect the peace process. mr blair held talks with his israeli counterpart ariel sharon and the palestinian leader mahmoud abbas. he confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the palestinian authority and address security issues would come at a london conference in march. mr blair also made a surprise trip to iraq this week. the israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend. mr blair briefly visited the tomb of yasser arafat in ramallah - the first world leader to do so. he nodded briefly towards the tomb rather than lay a wreath in what palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute. the bbc s paul reynolds says the london conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of mahmoud abbas also known as abu mazen who is expected to win the palestinian presidential election on january. at a news conference following talks with mr blair mr abbas said the british prime minister was in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit . he added: your endeavour to hold a conference in london is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose. in an interview with the bbc s political editor andrew marr mr blair said getting progress between israelis and palestinians would be tough but at least we have got the first step . mr blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the israelis but said the israelis were entitled to expect palestinians to give up terrorism. he argued that mr sharon was committed to the internationally-agreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from gaza had to be part of the peace process not the end of it. earlier mr sharon again said he had not seen the slightest step the palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. before visiting israel mr blair made a surprise visit to iraq where he met leaders in baghdad during his first trip to the city. he was briefed on preparations for the national poll which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence. he also flew to basra in southern iraq where british forces are stationed.
1704,brainwave cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer. four people two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with electrodes. previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. the results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. the research team from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought. the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which meant no surgery or implantation was needed. brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. the impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis said the researchers. the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. earlier this year a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.

1043,video phones act as dating tools technologies from e-mail to net chatrooms instant messaging and mobiles have proved to be a big pull with those looking for love. the lure once was that you could hide behind the technology but now video phones are in on the act to add vision. hundreds have submitted a mobile video profile to win a place at the world s first video mobile dating event. the top meet their match on november at london s institute of contemporary arts (ica). the event organised by the network could catch on as the trend for unusual dating events like speed dating continues. it s the beginning of the end of the blind date as we know it said graeme oxby s marketing director. the response has been so promising that says it is planning to launch a proper commercial dating service soon. hundreds of hopefuls submitted their profiles and special booths were set up in a major london department store for two weeks where expert tips were given on how to visually improve their chances. the most popular contestants voted by the public will gather at the ica in separate rooms and meet by phone. dating services and other more adult match-making services are proving to be a strong stream of revenue worth millions for mobile companies. whether it does actually provide an interesting match for video phone technologies remains to be seen. flic everett journalist and dating expert for company magazine and the daily express thinks technology has been liberating for some nervous soul-mate seekers. there are currently about . million video phones in use in the uk and three times more single people in britain than there were years ago with more people buying video mobiles dating could be the basis for a successful and safe way to meet people. one of the problems with video phones is people don t really know what to video. it is a weird technology. we have not quite worked out what it is for. this gives it a focus and a useful one she told bbc news. i would never have thought online dating would take off the way it did she said. lots of people find it easier to be honest writing e-mail or text than face-to-face. lots people are quite shy and they feel vulnerable. when you are writing it comes directly onto the page so they tend to be more honest. but the barrier that comes with sms chat and online match-making is that the person behind the profile may not be who they really are. scare stories have put people off as a result according to ms everett. many physical clues body language odd twitches are obviously missing with sms and online dating services. still images do not necessarily provide all those necessary cues. it could really take off because you do get the whole package. with a static e-mail picture you don t know who the person is behind it is. so checking out a potential date by video phone also gives singletons a different kind of barrier an extra layer of protection; a case of wlts before wltm. if you are trapped in real-life blind date context you can t get away and you feel embarrassed. with a video meeting you really have the barrier of the phone so if you don t like them you don t have to suffer the embarrassment. there is a more serious side to this new use of technology though. with money being made through more adult-themes content and services which let people meet and chat the revenue streams for mobile carriers will grow with thinks paolo pescatore mobile industry specialist for analysts idc. wireless is a medium that is being exploited with a number of features and services. one is chatting and the dating element is key there he said. the foundation has been set by sms and companies are using media like mms and video to grow the market further. but carriers need to be wary and ensure that if they do launch such dating services they ensure mechanism are in place to monitor and be aware who is registers and accesses these services on regular basis he cautioned. in july vodafone introduced a content control system to protect children from such adult content. the move was as a result of a code of practice agreed by the uk s six largest mobile phone operators in january. the system means vodafone users need to prove they are over before firewalls are lifted on explicit websites or chat rooms dealing with adult themes. the impetus was the growing number of people with handsets that could access the net and the growth of technologies.
2072,hatfield executives go on trial engineering firm balfour beatty and five railway managers are to go on trial for manslaughter over the hatfield rail crash in . four people died when a section of rail broke and a high speed train derailed. balfour beatty s railway maintenance arm was in charge of the upkeep of the line at hatfield hertfordshire. balfour beatty managers anthony walker and nicholas jeffries and railtrack managers alistair cook sean fugill and keith lea all face individual charges. all five men along with four others are also accused of breaches of health and safety laws. balfour beatty rail maintenance faces a corporate manslaughter charge. it is expected the trial could last as long as a year. the accident on october happened when the london to leeds express came off the tracks at mph when it was derailed by a cracked section of rail. the accident on the east coast main line sparked major disruption. the overall responsibility for the line was railtrack s - the company that has now become network rail. those who died in the accident were steve arthur from pease pottage west sussex; peter monkhouse of headingley leeds; leslie gray of tuxford nottingham; and robert james alcorn of auckland new zealand.
1544,jobs go at oracle after takeover oracle has announced it is cutting about jobs following the completion of its $. takeover of its smaller rival peoplesoft last week. the company said it would retain more than % of peoplesoft product development and product support staff. the cuts will affect about % of the staff of the combined companies. oracle s -month fight to acquire peoplesoft was one of the most drawn-out and hard-fought us takeover battles of recent times. the merged companies are set to be a major force in the enterprise software market second only in size to germany s sap. in a statement oracle said it began notifying staff of redundancies on friday and the process would continue over the next days. by retaining the vast majority of peoplesoft technical staff oracle will have the resources to deliver on the development and support commitments we have made to peoplesoft customers over the last months oracle s chief executive larry ellison said in a statement. correspondents say job losses had been expected - and some suggest more cuts may be announced in future. they say mr ellison may be trying to placate peoplesoft customers riled by oracle s determined takeover strategy. hours before friday s announcement there was a funereal air at peoplesoft s headquarters reported ap news agency. a peoplesoft sign had been turned into shrine to the company with flowers candles and company memorabilia. we re mourning the passing of a great company the agency quoted peoplesoft worker david ogden as saying. other employees said they would rather be sacked than work for oracle. the new company is going to be totally different said anil aggarwal peoplesoft s director of database markets. peoplesoft had an easygoing relaxed atmosphere. oracle has an edgy aggressive atmosphere that s not conducive to innovative production. on the news oracle shares rose cents - .% - on nasdaq. in after-hours trading the shares did not move.
862,leaders meet over turkish eu bid tony blair has met italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schroeder to talk about turkey entering the eu. the downing street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an eu summit in brussels later in the week. mr blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring turkey within the recently-expanded eu. italy and germany also favour an early start to talks but there is scepticism in france and elsewhere. some are worried that turkey s large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the eu difficult. some are concerned that a change of government could lead to turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted. and many in france would prefer turkey to admit that world war i-era killing of armenians constituted genocide. there are also issues in france and the netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major muslim nation into the eu. but mr blair and the labour government have been the staunchest backers of turkish accession provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform. mr blair s official spokesman said: the prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of european councils. the key issue at this week s council will be that of turkey but they will also discuss a range of other matters.
1198,sales fail to boost high street the january sales have failed to help the uk high street recover from a poor christmas season a survey has found. stores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to december levels the british retail consortium and accountants kpmg said. sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by .% on a like-for-like basis compared with a year earlier. consumers remain cautious over buying big-ticket items like furniture said brc director general kevin hawkins. higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market continue to take their toll on the retail sector the brc said. but clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than december while department stores also had a good month. in the three-months to january like-for-like sales showed a growth rate of -.% the same as in the three months to december the brc said. following a relatively strong new year s bank holiday trading then took a downward turn said mr hawkins. even extending some promotions and discounts and the pay-day boost later in the month could not tempt customers. the previous brc survey found christmas was the worst for years for retailers. and according to office for national statistics data sales in december failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since .

869,voters reject eu by two to one british voters would reject the european constitution by two to one according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country. the daily telegraph poll suggests that % of people would vote against the constitution and % in favour. however the yougov poll which questioned british adults online found % did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. only % of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. another % said they would not vote at all. the poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum expected in . the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote. ballot papers in the poll will ask: should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union the government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week. the treaty was signed by all current eu members in rome last october and is due to come into force in november providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged -state eu. if we reject this treaty britain will be isolated and weak in europe said foreign secretary jack straw after the question was unveiled. mr straw along with the rest of the cabinet will back a yes vote. meanwhile conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question seems straightforward . but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution when they should be treated as two separate issues .
1130,what price for trusted pc security you can now buy trusted computers but can we really trust the pc vendors asks technology analyst bill thompson. if you have recently bought an ibm thinkvantage computer a dell optiplex or one of a whole range of laptops from toshiba hp/compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (tpm) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children s toys. but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. and as part of a well-designed network system it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. a big advantage of the tpm is that it is hardware-based. at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. it might be password-protected user accounts data encryption programs or a firewall but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor. hardware security is less common even if it is a lot safer. this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password but also because its more work for users systems administrators and managers. as a result we settle for second best. so when it comes to computer security trusted systems could be a major step forward. after all if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. and if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. instead you have to use special software like hp s protecttools or wave systems embassy. this provides file encryption password management and identity protection usually for business users who connect to company networks. full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from microsoft until the next release of windows longhorn . this will include what microsoft in a typical act of obscurantism calls the next generation secure computing base and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. when that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. however there is a downside to the increased security from viruses spyware and data theft that this will provide. because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (drm) systems more secure this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music movies and books that we have bought from them. we have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. users of apple s itunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other itunes users a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection. but the latest version of itunes limits this capability just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a cd. another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from real s harmony service on your ipod. apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. similarly users of tivo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. this happens because of changes that tivo have made to their software and the users cannot control it. one wonders whether hardware-based drm will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. it will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. once it is unlocked then someone somewhere will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. and once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. the efforts going into drm would be much better spent building efficient distribution services finding business models that are based on trusting your customers and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. what we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. the record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us most of the time will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. they will benefit more by building a market in which i can share songs with my friends record shows i want to watch later and burn cds for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. we need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.
1758,india s deccan seals $. deal air deccan has ordered airbus planes in a $. (£) deal as india s first low-cost airline expands in the fast-growing domestic market. air deccan was set up last year and wants to lure travellers away from the railway network and pricier rivals. the potential of the indian market has attracted attention at home and abroad. beer magnate vijay mallya recently set up kingfisher airlines while uk entrepreneur richard branson has said he is keen to start a local operation. the country has a population of more than a billion people and many observers feel that it is underserved by airlines. recently however the booming economy has boosted personal spending power and helped swell the middle classes and the corporate sector. india s government has given its backing to cheaper and more accessible air travel. the days of flying being a symbol of only maharajas or the rich are over the minister for civil aviation praful patel said earlier. infrastructure is being built to handle the expected increase in demand and on tuesday agence france presse reported that a group led by germany s siemens won the contract to build a private airport near bangalore. india s airports authority and the state government will own % each of the finished transport hub. for its part air deccan set up by army officer and silk farmer gorur gopinath plans to increase its fleet to aircraft within five years. to help finance the expansion the company may sell a % stake to an investor for about $. when it was set up the firm offered tickets that were % cheaper than other indian airlines. it said it was basing its business model on european firms such as ireland s ryanair.
736,o sullivan keeps his powder dry when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential. ireland coach eddie o sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season s six nations championship. he decreed after the world cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year. that became a reality at the end of last summer with a -week period at the start of the this season. it may have annoyed his scottish and in particularly welsh cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league. we will say nothing of mike ruddock poaching eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday. but like o sullivan he was well within his rights particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it. the irfu has thrown their weight behind o sullivan who must be glad that in the main there is centrally-controlled contracts. bar keith gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg everyone of o sullivan s squad is fit fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season s campaign. but i doubt whether o sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players. he is not that sort of person. however he may look at the overworked and injury-hit england wales and france squads whose players have been overworked and then pat himself on the back for his foresight. but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game. already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season. a first grand slam since karl mullen s led the team to a clean sweep in . with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down everything looks perfectly placed. but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman. under the burden of great expectations ireland have crumpled. take the triple crown-winning side of under mick doyle. they were expected to up the ante further for a grand slam only the second in ireland s history. what happened in whitewashed. you see ireland in any sport love to be downsized. then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary. it is the nature of the beast. but o sullivan s side are very capable of proving a salient point this season. after their first triple crown for years they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder. o sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players and they have repaid him in spades ... and there is more to come. he has some old dogs in his squad but he will come to this season s championship with a different box of tricks and a new verve to succeed. ireland can indeed succeed but just whisper it.
1560,china had role in yukos split-up china lent russia $ (£.) to help the russian government renationalise the key yuganskneftegas unit of oil group yukos it has been revealed. the kremlin said on tuesday that the $ which russian state bank veb lent state-owned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks. the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with china. the deal sees rosneft receive $ in credits from china s cnpc. according to russian newspaper vedomosti these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk. reports said cnpc had been offered % of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos yugansk s former owner if cnpc had become a shareholder. rosneft and veb declined to comment. the two companies [rosneft and cnpc] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries said russian oil official sergei oganesyan. there is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years. the announcements help to explain how rosneft a medium-sized indebted and relatively unknown firm was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk. yugansk was sold for $. in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a $ bill in unpaid taxes and fines. the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. once the country s richest man mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion. the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of china s desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. china s thirst for products such as crude oil copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage [in russia] said dmitry lukashov an analyst at brokerage aton. they understand property rights in russia are not the most important rights and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies. if the price of oil is fixed under the deal which is unlikely it could be very profitable for the chinese mr lukashov continued. and rosneft is in desperate need of cash so it s a good deal for them too.
1439,moore questions captaincy brian moore believes the england captain should not be a full-back. jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament in the absence of fly-half jonny wilkinson. the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson a lock forward. and former england captain moore told the bbc: full-backs are too far away from the action. that s not a reflection on robinson personally. he added: i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack - which is after all where games usually start and finish. moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales france and ireland in this year s tournament. assertiveness in the pack isn t there we re not getting enough people into the breakdowns he explained. wer e not getting quick ball which means the backs are being stifled. their creativity depends on quick ball and we re not getting that. with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance. and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further. the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don t have the requisite experience moore added. you can t do anything about that but play them. there are players who have been knocking on the door it s time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there s nothing on them. we then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby.
1289,poles play with gameboy blip-pop a group of artists in poland has taken the cacophony of blips boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on nintendo s handheld gameboy console to a new level. the gameboyzz orchestra project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed blip-pop. think of it as donkey kong meets norman cook or maybe tetris takes on kraftwerk. any way you slice it the sound is distinct. all the sounds are made by six nintendo gameboys with a mixture of older models and newer advance sp handhelds. the gameboyzz orchestra project tweaks the software a bit and then connects the units through a mixing board. jarek kujda one of the project s founding members has been into electronic music and video games for a while now. i was playing some experimental music and three four years ago when i first used a gameboy in my band as a drum machine said kujda. he realised that the console could be used as a rudimentary synthesizer. he wondered if one gameboy can make music what would happen if he put six of them together kujda found five other people who were interested and the gameboyzz orchestra project was born. gameboyzz orchestra project is more of an improvisational project said kudja. we prepare some patterns before a concert and then improvise during the concert. the group plays maybe four or five shows a year. malgorzata kujda jarek s younger sister and a fellow band member describes a gameboyzz orchestra project concert as a lot of noise. for example i make music with more hard beats and noises she said. but each of us makes another music a different sound. and then in the concert we just improvise and that i think is more fun for us. the gameboyzz orchestra project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences. some love the group s music and others are not quite sure what to make of it. in the world of electronic music these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique. but jarek kujda says they try to be unique. we have lots of people making music on old school stuff electronic old school stuff like commodore atari spectrum he said. we want to play only experimental music not cover songs. we re something like an electronic jam session. the gameboyzz orchestra project s tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a cd next year. and they have sponsorship courtesy of the polish distributor of nintendo products. the members of the gameboyzz orchestra project do not expect serious competition anytime soon. a gameboy advance costs about us $ in poland these days which is still way beyond the reach of most polish gamers or musicians. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production
690,mp attacked by muggers in kenya an mp has had more than £ and his passport stolen after being mugged by six men in a park in kenya. quentin davies the mp for grantham and stamford was attacked in a notoriously dangerous park in the capital nairobi. he was not hurt in the mugging on saturday evening. several people are being questioned over the attack. he was in kenya before travelling to sudan with the parliamentary committee. local police were said to be surprised he was in the area. mr davies said the mugging occurred yards from the nairobi serena hotel and equally close to the anglican cathedral in the centre of the city at dusk. he said in a statement: it was a frightening experience. six men managed to steal up on me and grab me from behind. i knew i had to stay very calm and passive - you cannot fight six men . he had to spend an extra hours in nairobi before rejoining the rest of the house of commons international development committee in dafur after the mugging. naturally i was afraid they would use a knife or gun though they never produced any weapon he said. two of them held me from behind and two others held my legs and another one expertly rifled all my pockets.
2097,pop band busted to take a break chart-topping pop band busted have confirmed that they plan to take a break following rumours that they were on the verge of splitting. a statement from the band s record company universal said frontman charlie simpson planned to spend some time working with his other band fightstar. however they said that busted would reconvene in due course . the band have had eight top three hits including four number ones since they first hit the charts in . their singles include what i go to school for year crashed the wedding you said no and who s david the band which also includes members matt jay and james bourne made the top ten with their self-titled debut album as well as the follow-up a present for everyone in . they won best pop act and best breakthrough act at the brit awards and were nominated for best british group. most recently they topped the charts with the theme from the live-action film version of thunderbirds which was voted record of the year on the show. the band have capitalised on a craze for artists playing catchy pop music with rock overtones. the trio are seen as an alternative to more manufactured artists who are not considered credible musicians because they do not write their own songs or play their own instruments. however recent rumours have suggested that simpson has been wanting to quit the band to focus on fightstar. he now plans to take fightstar on tour.
310,mps issued with blackberry threat mps will be thrown out of the commons if they use blackberries in the chamber speaker michael martin has ruled. the £ handheld computers can be used as a phone pager or to send e-mails. the devices gained new prominence this week after alastair campbell used his to accidentally send an expletive-laden message to a newsnight journalist. mr martin revealed some mps had been using their blackberries during debates and he also cautioned members against using hidden earpieces. the use of electronic devices in the commons chamber has long been frowned on. the sound of a mobile phone or a pager can result in a strong rebuke from either the speaker or his deputies. the speaker chairs debates in the commons and is charged with ensuring order in the chamber and enforcing rules and conventions of the house. he or she is always an mp chosen by colleagues who once nominated gives up all party political allegiances.
1955,hewitt survives nalbandian epic home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic five-set battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semi-finals. hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a two-set lead. but nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider. hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the game and served out to win - - - - - and set up a meeting with andy roddick. the winner of that match will face either roger federer or marat safin in the final. ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets. the argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying hewitt s exuberant on-court celebrations were not very good for the sport . and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs. the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip and he double-faulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set. but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat. he then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes. i just kept hanging in there. it was always tough serving second in the fifth set said hewitt who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam. i told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again. it s a long way from holding that trophy up there but i m hanging in there. only four guys left that can win and we re the top four in the world. it s set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals.
2143,camera phones are must-haves four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of than last year says a report from analysts gartner. globally the number sold will reach million an increase of %. the report predicts that nearly % of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by . improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly must-have buy. in europe cameras on mobiles can take . megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific where camera phone technology is much more advanced mobiles have already been released which can take . megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology and the uptake there is huge. by according to gartner % of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them. camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services). this has changed in the last months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways they have introduced more design features like rotating screens and viewfinders removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages. mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites or mobile blogs - moblogs. but the report suggests that until image quality increases more people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. the gartner report suggests that by mid- it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. some handsets already feature limited zoom capability and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions like nightclubs. other developments include wide-angle modes basic editing features and better sensors and processors for recording film clips. images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists. the exhibition fonetography will feature images taken by photographers david bailey rankin and nan goldin and artists sir peter blake tracey emin and jack vettriano. but some uses for them have worried many organisations. intel samsung the uk s foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. many schools fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. italy s information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers profits. according to recent figures sony ericsson s profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. over % of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras it said.
226,learning to love broadband we are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life at least for some argues technology analyst bill thompson. one of the nice things about being a writer is that i rarely have to go to an office to work. i can sit in a caf& or a library with or without a wi-fi connection and research and write articles. if i am passing through kings cross station on my way to a meeting then i can log on from the platform. and i can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne a children s writer at her house in cambridge sharing her wireless network. but just over a week ago i arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection. we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again. she called her service provider and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem. this did not seem too bad but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday. with no modem installed in her computer she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial-up connection on her daughter s laptop so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection. as a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial-up. she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively. but the impact spread into her personal life too. she did not take her children to the cinema during half-term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas. she planned a trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website. and she did not know where to go fossil-hunting on the trip because she could not type fossils norfolk into google. of course she readily admits she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper listened to the radio or found a book on fossils. but she did not because having fast always on and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things. she may be unusual but i do not think anne is alone. according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april and numbers are climbing fast. there will certainly be five million by the end of the year. dial-up users are switching to broadband. my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start. more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason. it is part of the process of adaptation and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere. people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it and show off the cool stuff they can do. they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity. of course broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world. in south korea japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits or millions of bits a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with. but speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband and when it comes to checking websites for film times looking at weather forecasts or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives even uk speeds are sufficient. it may not be the brave new world of streaming full-screen video and superfast file downloads but it will do for now. and it is certainly better than slow access or no access. just ask anne. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.
1084,gsk aims to stop aids profiteers one of the world s largest manufacturers of hiv/aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills - supplied to poorer african countries - back into europe for resale at far higher price. the company glaxosmithkline is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement. it is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way. this is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies. they want to maintain their profits but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti-aids drugs to the world s poorest nations. the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe; bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hiv-positive africans through their government s health care systems. but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re-selling them at a higher price. glaxosmithkline believes that by coating the pills destined for africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging then this trade can be substantially reduced. the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trade. glaxo says distribution of the new-look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in europe.
1255,britannia members £ windfall more than britannia building society members are to receive a profit share worth on average £ each. members of the uk s second largest building society will share £ with receiving a windfall of more than £. depending on how much they borrow or invest members earn reward points which entitle them to a share of the society s profits. the payouts are bigger than last year because of stricter eligibility rules. last year britannia members shared £ but the average payment was only £. to qualify for this year s payment customers must have been members for at least two years on december . britannia has also stopped making payments to members if they are worth less than £. to qualify for the profit share members must have either a mortgage or an investment account other than a deposit account. customers can also qualify if they have permanent interest bearing shares (pibs). the profit share scheme was introduced in and has paid out more than £. britannia will unveil its results on wednesday.
641,kennedy predicts bigger turnout voters pent up passion could confound predictions of a low turnout in the coming general election charles kennedy has said. the liberal democrat leader predicted concerns over iraq and other international and domestic issue would express themselves during the campaign. his comments come as an inquiry looks at how best to boost voter turnouts. ex-foreign secretary robin cook said people were not apathetic but fed up of pager politics and not being heard. he like mr kennedy pointed to the hundreds of thousands of people who demonstrated against plans for the iraq war. mr cook who is giving evidence to the power inquiry into voter turnout rates told bbc radio s today programme it was not fair to blame the public who were more interested in politics than ever before . they are turned off by the way we do politics in britain. there s a message there for politicians. he urged politicians to avoid negative campaigning and to speak more from the heart . we should be not so afraid to say what we stand for. he also criticised the cult of personality politics: there s far too much interest in celebrities. politics are in danger of becoming another branch of the celebrity industry. the government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout which fell to % in the last general election in . this has included bringing in directly elected mayors to head local authorities and trialling postal voting.
2162,who do you think you are the real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net argues analyst bill thompson. it is what happens when it arrives at the other end. the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data. the fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society - our identities. armed with the personal details that a bank holds plus a fake letter or two it is apparently easy to get a loan open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else s name. and it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving. identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish. but however careful you may be if the organisations you trust with your personal data bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble. it is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well-placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system. in fact i suspect that the fsa is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time. has anyone checked bob cratchit s family links to the criminal underworld i wonder and it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted. health authorities government agencies and of course the big e-commerce sites like amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters. the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to. and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details. fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office plugging it into a usb slot and sucking down customer files. companies like securewave for example can restrict the use of usb ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual s personal memory card. these solutions are not perfect but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system. however the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e-commerce and online trading - the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the back office . it has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked. in fact i do not know of a single case where an e-mail containing payment details has led to card fraud. there are simply too many e-mails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud. cd universe powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences. and just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name. whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused any organisation that processes personal data is of course bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it. unauthorised disclosure is not allowed but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice. this is not something we can just leave it to the market. the consequences of having one s identity stolen are too serious and markets respond too slowly. after all i bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that i did not even consider it when i heard about their security problems. i doubt many others have closed their accounts especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future. the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft. i have never felt comfortable with the us practice of suing everything that moves partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients so i know which i d prefer. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.
134,dollar hovers around record lows the us dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on friday as concern grows about the size of the us budget deficit. analysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in as investors worry about the state of the us economy. the bush administration s apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. however trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. this has amplified reactions to news analysts said adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in january. the dollar was trading at $. versus the euro on friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $. on thursday. one dollar bought . yen. disappointing business figures from chicago triggered the us currency s weakness on thursday. the national association of purchasing management-chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to . a bigger fall than expected. there are no dollar buyers now especially after the chicago data yesterday said abn amro s paul mackel. at the same time german chancellor gerhard schroeder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. mr berlusconi said the euro s strength was absolutely worrying for italian exports. mr schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. investors will now look towards february s meeting of finance ministers from the industrialised nations in london for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar s decline.
370,text messages aid disaster recovery text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia. the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency. sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television. the blogging world though might know him better by his online name morquendi. he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast. cell phone signals were weak. land lines were unreliable. so mr senanayake started sending out text messages. the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of who needs what and where . blogging friends in india took mr senanayake s text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders. thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent. and that s when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use. sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call he says. in every rural community there s at least one person who has access to a mobile phone or has a mobile phone and can receive messages. half a world away in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago taran rampersad read morquendi s messages. mr rampersad who used to work in the military knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. mr rampersad said: imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets and had a central place to send a text message to that effect. he can message the server so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field. he added: or send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region and they might have an excess of it and be able to shift supplies to the right places. mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september. last week he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia. in only hours he found dan lane a text message guru living in britain. the pair along with a group of dedicated techies are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache. the idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help. this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people says paul saffo a director at the california-based institute for the future. you may be halfway around the world from someone but in cyberspace you re just one click or one e-mail away he said that s put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they re not right on top of the tragedy. it is still very early days for the project though. in an e-mail dan lane calls it an early proof of concept. right now the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page or distribute it to an e-mail list. in the near future the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. but there s still another challenge. you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use. it s amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to and say look this is what we re trying to do and everything like that says mr rampersad. so the big problem right now is the same problem we re trying to solve - human communication. he is optimistic however. he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments too will sit up and take notice. and he stands by his motto courtesy of michelangelo: criticise by creating. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.
1014,howard dismisses tory tax fears michael howard has dismissed fears from some conservatives that his plans for £ tax cuts are too modest. he defended the package saying it was a plan for the tories first budget and he hoped to be able to go further. the tories on monday highlighted £ in wasteful spending they would stop to allow tax cuts reduced borrowing and more spending on key services. labour and the liberal democrats say the party s sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. the tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the party s mps that mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals. now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted. tory backbencher edward leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the financial times: i would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts. interviewed on bbc radio s jeremy vine show mr howard said: it is perfectly true that i am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts. on the other side there are people who say we won t be able to achieve these tax cuts. i think we have got it about right. mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes. he added: i would like to be able to do more and over time i am sure we will be able to do more but at the start we have got to recognise there is a limit to what we can do in one go in our first budget. i have got to be responsible about this. the latest tory plans came as campaigning for the election - widely expected in may - gathered pace. the liberal democrats launched their pre-election platform with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the authentic opposition particularly on the iraq war council tax and university tuition fees. lib dem treasury spokesman vince cable also branded the tory plans as fantasy economics . labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a fraudulent prospectus . the party on tuesday challenged the tories to publish the full report from david james the trouble-shooter they asked to identify possible savings. but the tories are in turn demanding that tony blair spell out which taxes he would raise if he wins the election.
1907,winn-dixie files for bankruptcy us supermarket group winn-dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by wal-mart. winn-dixie once among the most profitable of us grocers said chapter protection would enable it to successfully restructure. it said its stores would remain open but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites. the jacksonville florida-based firm has total debts of $. (£). in its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as us foods giant kraft foods which it owes $.. analysts say winn-dixie had not kept up with consumers demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. a -month restructuring plan was deemed a failure and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month winn-dixie s slide into bankruptcy was widely expected. the company s new chief executive peter lynch said winn-dixie would use the chapter breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around. this includes achieving significant cost reductions improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores he said. yet evan mann a senior bond analyst at gimme credit said mr lynch s job would not be easy as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers. the real big issue is what s going to happen over the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all their customers see this in their local newspapers he said.

868,moody joins up with england lewis moody has flown to dublin to join england s camp ahead of their rbs six nations game against ireland on sunday. despite joining the squad the leicester flanker only has a slim chance of playing because of an infection in his finger. a decision will be taken on saturday as to whether the -year-old will be declared fit. if he fails to recover in time for the game his place at the back of the pack will be taken by andy hazell. chris jones will then start the game on the bench. the chances of him playing are very slim said coach andy robinson. the infection is deeper than was thought. moody had to be put on a drip in an attempt to force antibiotics through his infected finger. he suffered the cut playing against france at twickenham and it became infected during a -minute outing as a replacement for leicester against newcastle last saturday. the mud got into it robinson added. he has had a big course of antibiotics but they haven t done the job we hoped they would. robinson has already been forced to make one change to the starting line-up with bath prop matt stevens coming in for the injured phil vickery. the -year-old has only made starts for his club but has made appearances from the bench. it can be frustrating but i ve had a lot more game time this season and i m ready for it stevens said. i ve been on tour with these boys and i ve been in the england set-up for two years so i know the calls and the way they play. stevens will be winning his third cap on sunday after coming on twice as a replacement on the tour to new zealand last year. robinson has confirmed that fly-half charlie hodgson will be the first-choice kicker despite his three missed penalties and a drop goal against france. charlie s state of mind is very good said robinson. obviously we are all disappointed we lost the french game and the circumstances in which we did. but he responded well last week in his goalkicking for sale and he will be our first-choice kicker this week. robinson also admits his side must improve their line-out work against irish duo malcolm o kelly and paul o connell one of the most effective partnerships in the game. in each game we ve missed a number of line-outs he added. it cost us the game against wales but it has improved. it was better against france and will have to go up another notch against ireland. it will be a huge battle. look at the way they tore us apart last year. if it doesn t function we will be in for a torrid time.
2020,ad sales boost time warner profit quarterly profits at us media giant timewarner jumped % to $. (£) for the three months to december from $ year-earlier. the firm which is now one of the biggest investors in google benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. timewarner said fourth quarter sales rose % to $. from $.. its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at warner bros and less users for aol. time warner said on friday that it now owns % of search-engine google. but its own internet business aol had has mixed fortunes. it lost subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. however the company said aol s underlying profit before exceptional items rose % on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. it hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to timewarner internet customers and will try to sign up aol s existing customers for high-speed broadband. timewarner also has to restate and results following a probe by the us securities exchange commission (sec) which is close to concluding. time warner s fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts expectations. but its film division saw profits slump % to $ helped by box-office flops alexander and catwoman a sharp contrast to year-earlier when the third and final film in the lord of the rings trilogy boosted results. for the full-year timewarner posted a profit of $. up % from its performance while revenues grew .% to $.. our financial performance was strong meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility chairman and chief executive richard parsons said. for timewarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around % and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins. timewarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into aol by us market regulators. it has already offered to pay $ to settle charges in a deal that is under review by the sec. the company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves which it previously set at $. it intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with german music publisher bertelsmann s purchase of a stake in aol europe which it had reported as advertising revenue. it will now book the sale of its stake in aol europe as a loss on the value of that stake.
223,no-one can define new hunt ban the new law banning hunting with dogs is so poorly drafted no-one can define the offence pro-hunt mps say. the accusation came after it emerged a devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to chase away unwanted animals from his farm. because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting. lib dem mp lembit opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules. north devon landowner giles bradshaw was put in touch with the middle way group of which mr opik is a co-chairman after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry defra. he had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the hunting act. mr bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain. the middle way group also said mr bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free. in a later conversation mr bradshaw was told that according to defra s lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was not in fact hunting as described in the hunting act therefore you would not be committing an offence . mr opik said: hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the hunting act. now defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting - chasing away which isn t even covered by the act. however all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals. how is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting exempt hunting drag hunting unintentional hunting a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away tory mp peter luff another co-chairman of middle way said that the legislation was so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence . it is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law. however i seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating. mike hobday of the league against cruel sports said: there is no confusion it is a matter of simple common sense. if mr bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence. if all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer then nobody can define that as hunting.
1528,new york rockers top talent poll new york electro-rock group the bravery have come top of the bbc news website s sound of poll to find the music scene s most promising new act. the bravery who have been compared to the cure and new order were the most heavily-tipped act in the survey of impartial critics and broadcasters. rock band keane won sound of while us rapper cent topped sound of . other new artists in this year s list include london indie group bloc party at second and uk rapper kano third. the bravery played their first gig in and have since supported bands including the libertines interpol and echo and the bunnymen. they were the subject of a record company bidding war in and their debut single unconditional caused a huge buzz when it was released in the uk in november. singer sam endicott said he felt great about coming top of the sound of list. anyone that says they don t want a zillion screaming fans is a jackass a liar he said. one of the experts to tip the bravery was the times music critic paul connolly who said they were spiky but in love with pop . chris hawkins host of bbc music s chart show said the band had great guitars and a mastery of the electro-clash sound . the bravery are proof alone that new york city is still home to hot new talent he said. alison howe producer of tv show later... with jools holland booked the group to appear the day after seeing them at a west london pub. they played like they were headlining the main stage at glastonbury she said. great songs a good look a touch of attitude and a cracking live band. q magazine reviews editor ted kessler said they were pretty-boy new york clothes horses with an unusually nimble ear for concise yearning pop in the mould of duran duran or the strokes . other pundits to take part in the survey included bbc radio dj trevor nelson nme editor conor mcnicholas top of the pops presenter fearne cotton glastonbury organiser emily eavis and bbc radio music editor colin martin. elsewhere on the top second-placed rock band bloc party began their rise after supporting franz ferdinand and uk garage mc kano in third is signed to the streets record label. us rapper the game is hip-hop great dr dre s latest protege while leeds group kaiser chiefs came fifth with a promise to lead a britpop revival. in last year s survey keane were followed by franz ferdinand razorlight and joss stone in the top five - all of whom were virtually unknown outside the music industry at that point. boy band mcfly were sixth while scissor sisters who had the uk s best-selling album of were seventh. in the survey the pundits were asked for tips for three acts they thought were capable of reaching the top in their chosen genre either in terms of sales or critical acclaim. the artists could be from any country and any musical genre but must not have had a uk top single been a contestant on a tv talent show or already be famous for doing something else such as a soap actor. those tips were then counted and compiled to make the top .
178,yukos owner sues russia for $ the majority owner of embattled russian oil firm yukos has sued the russian government for $. (£.). the kremlin last year seized and sold yukos main production arm yugansk to state-run oil group rosneft for $. to offset a massive back tax bill. group menatep the gibraltar-based holding company which controls % of yukos says this was illegal. menatep has already asked rosneft to repay a $ loan that yugansk had secured on its assets. the russian government s argument for selling yuganskneftegaz - the unit s full name - was that yukos owed more than $ in back taxes for the years from onwards. it accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze yukos accounts and seize yugansk. but critics say the sell-off and the assault on yukos finances are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. according to menatep the government s actions were contrary to the energy charter treaty which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. we have warned the russian government about their continuing attacks against yukos its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation said tim osborne a director of group menatep. the time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today. menatep said the value of its yukos shareholding had gone from $. to virtually nothing since as a result of the russian government s action as its shares have fallen %. according to its paris lawyer emmanuel gaillard of shearman and sterling the overall claim is based on that figure with a % addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in stockholm or the hague mr gaillard said. while russia has signed the charter it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for menatep to press its case. but mr gaillard told bbc news that the charter came into effect on signature not ratification. russia has said in the past that it is bound by it so as to attract foreign investors he said. yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a us court for bankruptcy protection. it took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of yugansk - first to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own was one of the founders of menatep. he has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.
482,losing yourself in online gaming online role playing games are time-consuming but enthralling flights from reality. but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight - and to offer a warning. an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time wrote travis anderson in texas. some of the comments were humorous: this game is so good i m not going to get it there s no way i could limit the hours i d spend playing it wrote charles macintyre from england. but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game (mmorpg): you need to get out more could be the motto of any mmorpg. shame they are getting more popular as you know this problem is just going to mushroom wrote stuart stanton-davies in huddersfield. scare-mongering articles about addictive video games have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices. gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession whether it is spending too much time in the gym in front of the television or reading poetry. unfortunately gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make. however stories about gamers spending to hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent. and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some. massively multiplayer online role playing games - mmorpgs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds. the scope of these games - like warcraft everquest ultima among others - is epic and exploration and adventure is almost infinite. part of the problem is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded mindless tasks to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure. such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing; not for no reason is everquest (eq) nicknamed evercrack. e hayot writing in the culture blogzine print culture said recently: i used to play the online role-playing game everquest a lot. by a lot i mean probably to hours a week on average and on weeks where i didn t have to work as many as or hours. he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour wasn t that unusual; lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much . you lie; you don t go into work because you had stuff to do at home ; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner you spend much less time watching tv (a good thing presumably) he wrote explaining how everquest took over his time. he quit the game he says because he realised life was more fun than everquest. let us be clear - such obsession is rare. but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far. almost people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month. only a fraction will descend into obsessives. the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind. jane who runs the website compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories. i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than some people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality she said. one unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote: on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me. i can t talk to him while he is playing. there is absolutely no point as he doesn t hear me or is so distracted that i get a ummm... ya a few minutes after i ask him a question. gaming widows has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers. but for some it is not in the least funny. another correspondent wrote: i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness. and some of them are even sadder: today our son was five days old. the sad truth is my husband spent hours today playing his warcraft game. he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online. video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised. but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream and games ever more immersive there will be no hiding place for social problems. i wish - hours a week was unusual but i think it probably isn t. an hour stretch isn t that surprising - i ve known people to play + hours at a stretch. i know of people who are spending their week s holiday from work playing warcraft. i know of people who would play ever[crack] in shifts...waking at to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they needed to appear. i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life. by all standards many of us are addicts. so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing..or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming i find myself longing to have the time to join them. i have been in a long term relationship for over years - since that began games have become more and more complex. and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time. i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct. i play games a lot definately over hours a week but i don t go missing work or other commitments in order to play games. i have about a year ago deleted every game on my computer. rpgs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword. unlike books or perhaps even tv you gain absolutely nothing. when you stop playing you re at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and since you ve gained nothing in the real world you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one. despite having little monetary value the rewards and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily. if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition. perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality my advice to gaming widows is if you can t beat em join em . that is try playing it yourself. if he wants to play as well well at least you ll be together somewhere... i was an addict and it cost me my relationship. i still play now but without the guilt hehe how long have i played in one sitting from morning till the early hours of the next day the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain i would hardly eat perhaps some toast smoke endlessly and drink. now thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job. for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate. obsessive behaviour is of course always cause for concern but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of reality . obviously somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem. this problem however has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality. an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be real any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human. if mmorpgs have a unique danger in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world but rather that they can be easily accessed /. the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming but with the nature of modern hour culture. the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them there s always another quest to do. a few of my friends have only had about hours sleep since it was released friday... championship manager consumed my life for years. one particular session started at about on a sunday paused for a brief sleep at on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another hour session. the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of hardcore gaming seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game. i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that. i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college. it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one. i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate. i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did others were less fortunate and dropped out of college. now that i am holding a job i avoid online rpgs like the plague. when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from : till :pm. when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well hence justifying playing it all evening. i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job. when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i m trying not to spend so much time on there. it s not easy. i feel as if i ve got a real addiction going on here. for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal. once it is completed that is it i am finished time to move on. i become obsessed to complete the goal so from that standpoint it is an addiction. in a game where you will never complete an ultimate goal well it would be like falling into a black pit. it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the pc game are easier and more fun than the real world. pretty scary implications if you think about it. i can t buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage i just know it!! i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games. they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly but this progress becomes exponentially slower requiring more and more time to reach the next level. i m sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor slowly building up my character stopping only for food and toilet breaks. thankfully i made a clean break and actually managed to sell my jedi account for £ - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum. seven years ago i began playing ultima online. this game dominated years of my life. they were wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had. online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others. something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life. whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv. gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction. when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year building up my stats completing evermore quests and battling ogres. but somehow i found time to get out even met someone and got married! has my life changed hell no! i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning. on with the fun! online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates. many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families relationships and good careers. a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted. according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs. the message to the government is clear either legalise drugs or outlaw online gaming!! sounds like there are some sad stories here - and i can believe them all. i play alot of warcraft myself and know full well how addictive it is. i am resolute that it will not take over my life. it certainly gets in the way though. i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it. i think i m obsessed with gaming in general i spend far too much time playing games like everquest and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to i m always thinking in the back if my mind that i d rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united. i am obsessed with online role playing games. it s not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc. i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning... as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively. furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect whereas other games and some other pursuits (such as being a couch potato) the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature. these games are like most things -- too much of anything is a bad thing but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too they can be great fun. living in korea at the moment they have lots pc bangs (internet cafes). nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games. i play xbox live every day. i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix. the longest i played was a hour straight session. i know i play for to long but it s an obsession that i can t control. can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up... but something i m increasingly concerned with... me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day we re both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv trying to frag some individual. it s getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming and enjoying real life... i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out. the longest period i played was hrs straight. i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive but have subsequently just bought the european version (couldn t help myself). in future i m going to regulate my time far more strictly. great game! having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking. but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment. most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into. unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person& health you can expect this not to decline but to get worse. these people are pathetic. they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and online universe absolutely meaningless. when i was a kid at school and i was on half term ultima online was the game ahhhh them was the days ! lol
1202,what now for british tennis tim henman s decision to quit davis cup tennis has left the british team with a gargantuan void to fill. the world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament (he has from his rubbers). and great britain s last davis cup win without henman came against slovenia as far back as . worse could follow according to former british team member chris bailey. bailey told bbc sport: after tim s announcement i doubt greg rusedski will be that far behind him. but without their top two where does that leave british ambitions in the sport s premier team event captain jeremy bates has singled out alex bogdanovic and andrew murray as potential replacements. the yugoslavian-born bogdanovic though is places below henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties - winning one and losing the other. murray on the other hand is in the current atp entry list and yet to make his cup debut. but bailey does see some hope for the future. he said: now we ve dropped down to the euro-africa zone the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore. britain s next opponents israel are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the - march match against a likely trio of bogdanovic murray and the -ranked arvind parmar. bailey said: it will be tough for gb to move up but there comes a time when our young players have to step up. this was always going to be inevitable with tim and greg s growing years. i m confident about the future. i wouldn t lay money on us getting back into the world group next year but i d imagine in five years time we ll be competing for the major honours. of those lining up to replace henman the -year-old murray with four futures titles under his belt last year looks the best long-term bet. murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over tim s mantle said bailey. he has an enormous amount of self-confidence judging by what he s said in the past. bogdanovic three years murray s senior has had a more troubled time under britain s davis cup umbrella. while murray has been marked out as britain s golden boy bogdanovic was warned by the lawn tennis association for a lack of drive at the end of . and bailey said: despite that alex is clearly talented as well while arvind is another contender. they re among the guys who have experienced the intensity of davis cup tennis - whether as players or on the sidelines. the lta has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that. now they ll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup. and i m confident that will springboard team gb to greater success.
694,holmes urged to compete at worlds jolanda ceplak has urged britain s kelly holmes to continue competing at the major championships. double olympic gold medallist holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this year s worlds and is undecided about next month s european indoors. but world indoor record holder ceplak said: there is never an easy race when she is in the field. there is only excitement at what might happen. it is good for the sport. she always fetches the best out of everyone. ceplak has been a great rival of holmes during the briton s career and the pair fell out when holmes questioned the manner of the slovenian s runaway victory at the european championships. but the controversy has since been forgotten with ceplak acting as pacemaker for holmes failed attempt on the british indoor record at the norwich union grand prix in birmingham in . ceplak added: i like running against her - you know the race is always going to be fast. that is the sort of competition that i like. she is special to me. she was like my idol from the beginning of my career. meanwhile ceplak will be looking to follow up last saturday s win in boston with a fast time and victory in friday s night of athletics in erfurt germany. britain s jason gardener had been expected to defend his title in erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in leipzig on sunday. gardener s decision means scotland s man ian mackie will carry british hopes in what looks sure to be a tough preparation for next weekend s norwich union european trials in sheffield.
1798,chepkemei hit by big ban kenya s athletics body has suspended two-time london marathon runner-up susan chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year. athletics kenya (ak) issued the ban after chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in embu. we have banned her from all local and international competitions said ak chief isaiah kiplagat. we shall communicate this decision to the iaaf and all meet directors all over the world. the -year-old finished second to paula radcliffe in the and london races and was also edged out in an epic new york marathon contest last year. but the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging radcliffe at this year s london event in april. global sports communications chepkemei s management company said she had wanted to run in the world cross country championships in march. but ak maintained it was making an example of chepkemei as a warning to other kenyan athletes. we are taking this action in order to salvage our pride said kiplagat. we have been accused of having no teeth to bite with and that agents are ruling over us. ka has also threatened three-time women s short-course champion edith masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true. masai missed the national trials in early february but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition. she failed to run in the event citing a leg injury.
102,why few targets are better than many the economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world s leading economy by . but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe doesn t become a global economic laggard. they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia india and china as well as with the economic might of the united states. that s why there was a tone of urgency in the report out on wednesday by the former dutch prime minister wim kok. mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets five years on from their inception. his conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed. lisbon risks becoming a synonym for missed objectives and failed promises his report said. the status quo is not an option. at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built it said. the report comes at a time when europe s competitive position is waning. the eu s economic growth rate is projected to be % this year and .% next. while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe productivity lags behind that of the us. but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far. that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years. as mr kok s report noted: the ink had scarcely dried on the [lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded. the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit. the circumstances weren t conducive to creating the million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in . neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a so-called knowledge-based economy . the [lisbon] vision is a compelling one but in order to do it society has to change said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council a brussels-based citizen action group. what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change. you find trade unions fighting change. but also the employers associations. even though they tell you they re in favour of change many are actually pushing for less competition more subsidy and less free market activity. but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago. targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case they covered too much according to the wim report. economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion and even safety at sea. the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised. lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing the kok report said. everybody is responsible and thus no one. that s why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to key indicators with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they re taking towards meeting the targets effectively naming shaming and faming . rhetoric and delivery don t necessarily go hand in hand mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report. we don t have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another. on one point mr kok was very clear: the european union should not try to emulate the us economy. the european economic and social model needs to change but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. in that sense the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth. it s very ambitious said john palmer political director at the european policy centre a brussels-based think-tank. this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do. it s going to require quite new and innovative policies. but some analysts believe that the kok report doesn t come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality. for example it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce. but it doesn t say how companies should be convinced to do this. it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission jose manuel barroso to adopt mr kok s recommendations and press them on eu governments. mr barroso has said that the eu s competitiveness will be his top priority. he expects his five-year term in office to be judged on europe s success in meeting the lisbon agenda.

1351,ethnic producers face barriers minority ethnic led (mel) production companies face barriers in succeeding in the film and television industries research has suggested. the study commissioned by pact and the uk film council included interviews with industry experts and individuals. they indicated that career progression and a lack of role models are among the main problems within such companies. the research indicated that about % of independent production companies in the uk are minority ethnic led. a minority ethnic led company is defined as one in which the majority of decision-making power rests with an individual or individuals from a minority ethnic group. the report also explored the problems faced by such companies when attempting to compete within the film and tv industries. it said they are often smaller than other companies and lack the resources so are often squeezed out of the market by bigger firms. the research recommended that minority ethnic led companies could benefit from such positive actions as career training and business advice plus improved communication within the film and tv sectors. the uk has a rich and diverse culture and it is essential that it is reflected on film and television said arts minister estelle morris of the findings. i welcome this report which i hope will lead to more doors being opened and all businesses in our film and television industries being given the same opportunities.
1986,uk set to cut back on embassies nine overseas embassies and high commissions will close in an effort to save money uk foreign secretary jack straw has announced. the bahamas east timor madagascar and swaziland are among the areas affected by the biggest shake-up for the diplomatic service for years. other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff. mr straw said the move would save £ a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism. honorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures. nine consulates or consulates general will also be closed mostly in europe and america. they include dallas in the us bordeaux in france and oporto in portugal with local staff replacing uk representation in another . the changes are due to be put in place before the end of with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs. some of the money will have to be used to fund redundancy payments. in a written statement mr straw said: the savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the foreign and commonwealth office s strategic priorities including counter- proliferation counter-terrorism energy and climate change. some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. in africa for instance we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region with a new post in nairobi to help support our work on climate change one in nigeria to cover energy and one in pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering maseru and mbabane. the foreign office currently has about uk-based staff. it has opened major new missions on baghdad and basra in iraq kabul in afghanistan and pyongyang in north korea since in response to what the government says are changing needs. since overseas posts have been closed - excluding wednesday s cuts - but new embassies or consulates have been opened. the shake-up is aimed at helping making £ in efficiency savings between and . the chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions. but the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that british commercial interests and the interests of britons abroad will not be adversely affected he said.
1041,aviator creator in oscars snub the man who said he got oscar-nominated movie the aviator off the ground and signed up leonardo dicaprio has been shut out of the academy awards race. charles evans jr battled over his role with the people who eventually made the film and won a producer s credit. but he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. the oscars organisers have picked two of the aviator s four producers to be nominated for best film. up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind the aviator and million dollar baby failed to trim their credits - so the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences (ampas) has done it for them. the aviator s nominated producers are michael mann and graham king - with mr evans and sandy climan mr mann s former deputy left off. mr evans sued mr mann in claiming he came up with the idea spent years developing it and persuaded dicaprio to play hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. the two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact mr evans name has appeared as a producer when the film s credits roll. at the golden globes mr evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with dicaprio director martin scorsese mr mann and mr king. ampas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after shakespeare in love s victory in saw five producers collect awards. the eligible names for the aviator and million dollar baby were decided by ampas producers branch executive committee on wednesday. the decision also saw clint eastwood get his third personal nomination for million dollar baby. he is now named in the best film category as well as being nominated for best director and best lead actor. the academy awards ceremony will be held in hollywood on february. chinese actress ziyi zhang star of crouching tiger hidden dragon hero and house of flying daggers is the latest name to be added to the list of presenters on the night.
731,wood - ireland can win grand slam former captain keith wood believes ireland can win only their second grand slam - and first since - in this year s rbs six nations championship. after claiming their first triple crown for years last season wood tips his former team-mates to go one better. things have been building up over the past few years and i think this is the year for ireland he told bbc sport. there is a great chance to win a grand slam. a lot of things are in our favour with england and france at home. ireland have finished runners-up three times including last year since the old five nations became six in and not finished outside the top three in the past five years. despite being without flanker keith gleeson coach eddie o sullivan has not had to contend with the sort of casualty lists that have hit england and scotland in particular prior to the tournament. for ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far wood added. it is going to be tough and we need to take all the luck and opportunities that come our way. ireland s last game of the tournament is against wales in cardiff - a fixture they have not lost since . but despite their traditional hospitality when the irish are visiting wood believes wales might end their four-match losing run against england in cardiff. so many of the major england players have either retired in the last year or are injured that i think it will be very hard for them down in cardiff wood added. wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams.
581,reaction from spanish press england s - defeat to spain on wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the country s press on thursday. controversy was in no short supply with racist abuse of england s black players wayne rooney s petulance and england s inept performance. but what did the spanish press make of the affair bbc sport looks at the reaction. there is little coverage of the racist chanting on wednesday night s game. but as does cover the english reaction to the pre-match comments from spain coach luis aragones who highlighted britain s colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding thierry henry in october. journalist guillem balague writes: in our country where multi-culturalism is a new thing we are in nappies dealing with these things and have a naivety which makes the english nervous. marca refers in passing to the booing of england s black players - but only after referring to the cheers of ole which greeted the long periods of spanish possession. aragones no comment to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted as marca focuses on the spanish coach s praise for his players. serbia & montenegro s - world cup qualifying win in belgium - which could make qualification tougher for spain - seems to be of greater importance. elsewhere the spanish media criticises its english counterparts for stoking up the racism issue. were there racist chants against some players this hasn t happened in the spanish league and spain for many years said spanish federation press officer fernando garrido. so you (english reporters) should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this. and spanish daily abc accuses english reporters of launching a witch-hunt against aragones. perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue the paper says. what the boy in the bernabeu did was odd... rooney seemed intent to kick any spanish player who approached him. yet rooney is seen only as the worst example of many england miscreants with gary neville criticised for continuing the feud between manchester united and arsenal for his tackles on jose reyes. ashley cole s treatment of joaquin and a frank lampard foul on reyes are also lambasted for their ugliness . marca s headline says it all: wayne rooney se volvi& loco en el bernab& (wayne rooney became crazy in the bernabeu) rooney s display alarms the writer in particular three chilling fouls on joaquin casillas and marchena which could well have left them in the infirmary. and like as marca criticises gary neville for leaving a message on reyes ankle to remind him of the manchester united-arsenal clash this month. spain s first-half performance is showered with praise with xavi singled out as the biggest star. xavi did things on wednesday which were worthy of maradona the paper beams adding what a work-rate what dynamism what vision what leadership what a midfield player! on a controversial evening as offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint: spanish football players played better football than the english. more plaudits are given to the home team with jaime vargas lauding the manner in which spain dominated england with order and quality . the paper adds: the bad thing about spain v england was that it lasted only minutes after which a succession of changes prevented any real competition. vargas does not mention england s two galacticos simply adding in a ps: i have not forgotten to speak of beckham and owen. they forgot to play.
1996,brentford v southampton griffin park tuesday march gmt barry knight (kent) home to manchester united in the quarter-finals midfielder andrew frampton and striker deon burton are both slight doubts with hamstring injuries but should be fit saints are missing their entire first-choice midfield of jamie redknapp graeme le saux nigel quashie and david prutton. anders svensson and matt oakley are likely replacements with kevin phillips also scheduled to start with henri camara rested. - brentford boss martin allen: after conceding eight goals in our last three matches i have to admit i m not very confident. there s no doubt we re the underdogs and after defending so poorly recently it s not looking good. southampton have just drawn with the premiership champions and that makes our task harder than it was already. - southampton boss harry redknapp: we know they can give us problems. brentford have done well but we are the premiership side and should have the better players. staying in the premiership is our priority. we want to win of course we do. we ll battle but if it comes to a football match i think we ll win. key match stats - brentford are the lowest ranked club left in the fa cup. they re on their best run in the competition since reaching the quarter-finals for the fourth time in their history years ago. now they have the carrot of the plum draw in the last eight dangling before them. victory over premiership strugglers southampton would bring the mighty manchester united to griffin park and a gigantic pay day for the sole league one survivors. - martin allen s brave side came back from two goals down at st mary s to earn a deserved replay. southampton striker henri camara scored twice from close range to put the saints in command but isaiah rankin hit back just before half time and sam sodje headed past a creaky defence on minutes. - the londoners have conceded six goals in their two subsequent league outings - three each in losing away to hartlepool and drawing at home to sheffield wednesday. but they haven t lost in six league and cup games on home turf - winning three and drawing three since the reverse to torquay on boxing day. - southampton go into this tie on the back of an eventful premiership match with arsenal on saturday. an angry david prutton pushed referee alan wiley after being shown the red card but his side still came back to draw -. it was saints fourth stalemate in succession in all competitions but didn t lift them out of the relegation zone. the retention of their ever present premier league status must be the number one priority irrespective of the rewards that success against brentford would bring. - victory here would set up a repeat of the final when saints astounded the football world by defeating tommy docherty s manchester united courtesy of bobby stokes famous winner. they also knocked out the red devils in on penalties in the fourth round. but to write another chapter in their fa cup history the solent side must avoid succumbing to lower division opposition for the first time since rotherham from the second level beat them - in a third round tie at millmoor on january . southampton were last humbled by a club from the third tier six years ago. fulham were then in the second division when they won a third round replay at craven cottage - on january . - to get to within two matches of a second visit to the millennium stadium in three years for the final harry redknapp must guide his side past a club places inferior on the league ladder and a manager years his junior who played under him at west ham. head to head league one quarter-finals (four times) prem winners (once)
697,tory leader urges harry apology prince harry should personally make clear how sorry he is about wearing a nazi uniform to a friend s fancy dress party says tory leader michael howard. mr howard whose grandmother died in auschwitz said many people would be offended by the prince s actions clarence house has issued a statement saying the prince has apologised and realised it had been a poor costume. number said an error was made but now harry had apologised the matter should be left to the palace. that was a message repeated by home secretary charles clarke who said the matter should now be left to lie. but lib dem leader charles kennedy said harry was in a privileged position and said he should apologise in person. there is a reservoir of goodwill for prince harry and prince william with him in this country but i think he needs to remember that it can t last forever. he added that sandhurst would probably be good for harry as it would teach him some self discipline. former labour mp lord janner who is a high profile member of britain s jewish community branded harry s action s stupid and evil . he told itv: the time has come for him to make a public apology. it is about common decency of respect to the people who fought the nazis to the families of those who were killed by the nazis and to people who suffered during the holocaust. he added: i would send him in the army as fast as possible. i hope that would teach him not to behave like that. a photograph of prince harry wearing a swastika armband and german desert uniform at the party appears in thursday s sun newspaper under the headline: harry the nazi. mr howard acknowledged the prince s apology and said he had no doubt the prince s father and family would have much to say to him privately about the incident. but he told bbc radio s today programme: it might be appropriate to tell us himself just how contrite he is. mr howard declined to say what form the statement should take. but former buckingham palace press spokesman dicky arbiter said the prince should make a personal broadcast apology. mr clarke said he recognised people s concerns about the costume but argued: he has apologised and i think we should leave the matter there.
143,greene sets sights on world title maurice greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his olympic title in athens by winning a fourth world championship crown this summer. he had to settle for bronze in greece behind fellow american justin gatlin and francis obikwelu of portugal. it really hurts to look at that medal. it was my mistake. i lost because of the things i did said greene who races in birmingham on friday. it s never going to happen again. my goal - i m going to win the worlds. greene crossed the line just . seconds behind gatlin who won in . seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time. but greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals. in my semi-final race i should have won the race but i was conserving energy. that s when francis obikwelu came up and i took third because i didn t know he was there. i believe that s what put me in lane seven in the final and while i was in lane seven i couldn t feel anything in the race. i just felt like i was running all alone. i believe if i was in the middle of the race i would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me. greene was also denied olympic gold in the men s relay when he could not catch britain s mark lewis-francis on the final leg. the kansas star is set to go head-to-head with lewis-francis again at friday s norwich union grand prix. the pair contest the the distance over which greene currently holds the world record of . seconds. he then has another indoor meeting in france before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in helsinki in august. greene believes gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in finland. but he also admits he faces more than one rival for the world crown. there s always someone else coming. i think when i was coming up i would say there was me and ato (boldon) in the young crowd greene said. now you ve got about five or six young guys coming up at the same time.
2016,what high-definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition. high-definition gives incredible -like pictures and surround sound. the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment. for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy finding nemo the incredibles and indiana jones. there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website. the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined. the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says. but currently putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand. as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains. i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting. high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to. it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in months time. mr dean is confident though: i think if they see real hd [high-definition] not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference. i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen. high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. on the whole producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd. when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about . gigabits per second says mr dean. our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second. that s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about %. so if you have anything that allows more space you don t have to compress so hard. studios could fit a lot more marketing material games and features onto high-capacity dvds. currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean. although the step of down-converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save a day s work says mr dean. one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems. on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took human hours alone. if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay. if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required. and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd. but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean. high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike. more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous. when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i everybody was very sun-tanned but that was make-up. in the hd version of episode i all these make-up lines showed up explains mr dean. the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too. there are scans of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways. you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn t see it. what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further. it could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen. in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol - broadband] giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive says mr dean. but that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves.

553,games win for blu-ray dvd format the next-generation dvd format blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival according to its backers. blu-ray backed by firms including sony is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games. the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format. the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound. this offers incredible -like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of . as we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images we have a much greater need for storage richard doherty from panasonic s hollywood laboratories one of the pioneers of blu-ray told the bbc news website. so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today s dvd. a blu-ray disc will be able to store of high-quality data while toshiba s hd-dvd will hold . mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out. when players do come out they will be able to play standard dvds too which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds. but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to blu-ray in the battle for supremacy. gaming is a $ billion industry worldwide so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made. the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies said michael heilmann chief technology officer for vivendi universal. blu-ray offers the capacity performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming. ea a leading games developer and publisher added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations. mr doherty said gamers were ravenous for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles. gamers especially those working on pcs are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures deeper levels for delivering higher-resolution playback. he added: the focus for games moving forward on increased immersion. gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated models and textures and increasing the resolution increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience. fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. as games move to more photo-real capability the current technology is limiting. they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments said mr doherty. currently graphics-intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation. high-definition dvds will cut down on that need. likewise consoles rely on single discs so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better high-resolution games. blu-ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios such as mgm studios disney and buena vista as well as top technology firms like dell lg samsung and phillips amongst others. while toshiba s hd-dvd technology has won backing from paramount universal and warner bros. the real world benefits (of hd-dvd) are apparent and obvious said jim cardwell president of warner home video. mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd-dvd. both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox but discussions are still on-going. next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data. ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world and runs from to january.
1991,faith schools citizenship warning schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer says the education watchdog. independent faith schools were singled out by ofsted chief david bell for not doing enough to promote the wider tenets of british society . mr bell said muslim jewish and evangelical christian schools must be intolerant of intolerance . diversity certainly must not mean segregated or separate he said. mr bell s speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more. badly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by mr bell and in a speech to the hansard society he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy public service and shared values. he highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about muslim evangelical christian and jewish schools. mr bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a common heritage and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion. i worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to british society said mr bell. the ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to muslim schools. many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in england and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony. mr bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were tricky issues . but he argued that we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation . i would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as british citizens equal under the law should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships said mr bell.

830,chelsea hold arsenal a gripping game between arsenal and chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at highbury. thierry henry produced a sublime strike to put arsenal ahead but john terry levelled with a powerful header. henry s quickly-taken free-kick put arsenal back in front but eidur gudjohnsen equalised with a header from william gallas knockback. henry missed a golden chance when he blazed a shot high late on and arsenal also had a penalty appeal rejected. henry s opener had given arsenal the perfect start and set up an enthralling affair. the french striker headed a long cesc faregas ball back to jose antonio reyes from the edge of the chelsea area and immediately saw it headed back into his path from the spaniard. and with his back to goal henry finished with aplomb when he took one touch turned and struck an angled strike past the despairing dive of keeper petr cech. henry epitomised a determination about the arsenal side but chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after minutes. gunners keeper manuel almunia who got the nod ahead of jens lehmann did well to save a well-struck frank lampard shot. but he could not keep out terry s powered header from the resultant corner as arsenal s weakness at set-pieces was again exposed. almost immediately henry went close and chelsea gathered the loose ball before going straight up the other end where gudjohnsen fluffed an effort. gudjohnsen did not make the same error minutes later when he struck a sweet shot only for almunia to be equal to the task and save. the homes side regained the lead in controversial fashion when robert pires won a dubious free-kick. and given the option to take the -yard set-piece quickly henry curled in a shot with cech still organising his wall. this time arsenal did not allow chelsea to level so soon as they went into the break ahead. chelsea brought striker didier drogba on to partner gudjohnsen up front after the interval and the move reaped immediate reward. lampard swung in a cross which gallas knocked back across goal and a deft header from gudjohnsen levelled matters again. chelsea s main threat was coming from crosses and lampard missed a great opportunity as he headed wide when left unmarked at the far post. the second half failed to live up to the thrilling pace of the opening period but there were flashes of brilliance. one of them came from the enigmatic robben when he jinked his way through two arsenal defenders only to see his poked shot saved by almunia. arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked a excellent chance for henry who put a left-foot shot high from eight yards. subtitute robin van persie could also have nicked a win for the highbury outfit but frustratingly sidefooted just wide. matthieu flamini had a late penal appeal waved away before the final whistle which maintained chelsea five-point premiership lead over arsenal. almunia lauren toure campbell cole pires flamini fabregas reyes (clichy ) bergkamp (van persie ) henry. subs not used: senderos hoyte lehmann. cole. henry . cech paulo ferreira ricardo carvalho (drogba ) terry gallas duff tiago (bridge ) makelele lampard robben gudjohnsen (parker ). subs not used: kezman cudicini. robben drogba lampard. terry gudjohnsen . g poll (hertfordshire).

1738,golden economic period to end ten years of golden economic performance may come to an end in with growth slowing markedly city consultancy deloitte has warned. the uk economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment. deloitte is forecasting economic growth of % this year below chancellor gordon brown s forecast of % to .%. it also believes that interest rates will fall to % by the end of the year. in its quarterly economic review deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a golden period during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near year low and inflation at its lowest since the . but it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major imbalances in the economy. deloitte s chief economic advisor roger bootle said: the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown. whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace. economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes deloitte believes. gordon brown will need to raise about $ a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term the firm claims. this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in and compared to last year when the economy expanded by .%. however deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the bank of england to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. it expects a series of aggressive interest rate cuts over the next two years with the cost of borrowing falling from its current .% mark to .% by the end of . although may not be the year when things go completely wrong it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the uk economy mr bootle.

1787,fast lifts rise into record books two high-speed lifts at the world s tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet s fastest. the lifts take only seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the tall tfc tower in taipei taiwan. the guinness book of records has declared the per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on earth. the lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed. in total the tfc tower has lifts of them double-deckers and escalators to shuttle people around its floors. the tfc tower is due to be officially opened on december. the super-fast lifts can speed up to passengers to the tip of the tower in about seconds while ascending their track. the /s top speed of the lifts translates to about (/h). curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the tfc tower. the key new technologies applied in the world s fastest elevators include: - a pressure control system which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers preventing ear popping - an active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations - streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft the certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative guinness world records is a great honour for us said masayuki shimono president of manufacturer toshiba elevator and building systems which installed the lifts. the first record for the world s fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the guinness book of records in . as such it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the years since that first edition when the record was per minute or . km/h less than half the speed of the new record said hein le roux specialist researcher at the guinness world records. taipei s tfc tower is more than taller than the petronas towers in kuala lumpur malaysia - formerly the world s tallest skyscraper.
1365,j&j agrees $ guidant deal pharmaceutical giant johnson & johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm guidant for $. (£). guidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers. analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting johnson & johnson s reliance on a slowing drug business. they also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs. a number of johnson & johnson s products are facing patent expirations while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products. meanwhile demand for defibrillators which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected is expected to increase analysts said. the move by johnson & johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $ for each guidant share % more than wednesday s closing price. analysts say that us antitrust regulators could force the firms to shed some overlapping stent operations. stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked.
1848,mps murder sentence concern murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea says a new mps report. the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer. the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs. they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders. committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse. the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor. at present judges when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence can reduce the tariff - the minimum term they must serve - if the defendant pleads guilty. but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims relatives are unhappy. in july this year amanda champion s killer james ford pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least years - it would have been longer had he denied the charge. amanda s uncle lewis champion told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea saying: nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence. mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty. the measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill. as a result says the committee the government may need to re-legislate to remove ambiguity over how murderers should be sentenced. it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales lord woolf to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. the committee said the plans had not reflected the public disquiet expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers. lord woolf s sentencing guidelines council (sgc) caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime. as a result murderers who face a -year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police. mr denham believes the sgc should reconsider its proposals to reflect parliament s wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence. he said: we want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances. but a spokesman for the home office defended the proposals. he said: by making express provision for murder tariffs in the criminal justice act parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences. we stand by the provisions in the act that cover guilty plea discounts which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial. shadow home secretary david davis echoed criticisms of the way mr blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules. there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government s claim to be tough on crime he said. but liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten warned the mps committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference. the danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful it is also different he told bbc news.
1418,clarke faces id cards rebellion charles clarke faces his first real test as home secretary on monday with a possible backbench rebellion over the controversial id cards bill. up to labour mps could oppose the scheme during a commons debate. mr clarke who took on the post on thursday after david blunkett quit has rejected calls to pause on the bill. tory leader michael howard also faces a possible rebellion after deciding to back identity cards. the liberal democrats oppose the plans. mr clarke writing in the times accused some critics of liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears by claiming id cards would erode civil liberties. he writes that it is actually a profoundly civil libertarian measure because it promotes the most fundamental civil liberty in our society - which is the right to live free from fear crime and fear . mr clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed information they were not allowed to see would face up to two years in jail. he is also expected to cut the £ cost of the card and passport for the elderly and those on lower incomes. mr howard last week said his front bench team had reached a collective view to back id cards after holding a good discussion but admitted it was not an easy issue . he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror crime and illegal immigration. but former shadow attorney general bill cash said there was still very deep disquiet about the plan among senior tories. he told bbc radio s today the government was intensely authoritarian and was creating increasingly a big brother society . critics argue that introducing the cards would be a costly scheme with no specific aim. ministers say it would help the fight against terrorism illegal immigration and organised crime. but opponents say that similar schemes in other countries have not prevented attacks like the madrid rail bombing. on sunday lib dem leader charles kennedy repeated his call for a pause in considering the legislation. he told bbc s breakfast with frost programme that mr clarke had a real opportunity on monday following the departure of mr blunkett. if you were running a family or a business would you have the second reading of the identity cards bill tomorrow or would you pause to reflect and see what you might do about it in the new year that is the sensible way to go about it but i think this government has got itself so much into tram lines now that it is not behaving sensibly at all. the first cards would be issued in and when he was introducing the bill mr blunkett suggested parliament could decide in or whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards although not to carry them. the new bill would also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents.
1463,digital guru floats sub-$ pc nicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mit s media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than $ (£). he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood . he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linux-based operating system we have to get the display down to below $ to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. the second trick is to get rid of the fat if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory. the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on. while the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. we put in laptops three years ago only one has been broken the kids cherish these things it s also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook. mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. nokia make million cell phones a year so for us to claim we re going to make million laptops is a big number but we re not talking about doing it in three or five years we re talking about months. he plans to be distributing them by the end of and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. in china they spend $ per child per year on textbooks. that s for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.

328,india s deccan gets more planes air deccan has signed a deal to acquire planes from avions de transport regional (atr). the value of the deal has not been revealed because of a confidentiality clause in the agreement. but air deccan s managing director gorur gopinath has said the price agreed was less than the catalogue price of $.

357,market unfazed by aurora setback as the aurora limped back to its dock on january a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe. the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble. and its owner p&o cruises - now part of the huge us carnival corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year s profits and a potential pr fiasco. no-one however seems to have told the stock markets. the warning of a five-cent hit to earnings came just hours after one of the world s biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnival s share price from £ to £.. other investors barely blinked and by gmt carnival s shares in london were down a single penny or .% at £.. why the mismatch between the public perception and the market s response the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time says deutsche bank s simon champion. it was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise after all. but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events. despite its string of bad luck he pointed out aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet the uk s p&o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in . and generally speaking carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. carnival has an incredibly strong track record mr champion. similarly analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. that should mitigate some of the pr risk both for carnival and its main competitor royal caribbean. while not common cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday. moreover such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises. after all the aurora incident may be big news in the uk - but for carnival customers elsewhere it s unlikely to make too much of a splash. assuming that citigroup is right and demand stays solid the structure of the industry also works in carnival s favour. in the wake of p&o princess s takeover by carnival the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. given the expense of building outfitting and running a cruise ship slowing supply growth is a certainty said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday. in other words if you do want a cruise your options are limited. and with carnival remaining the market leader it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future.
1844,more reforms ahead says milburn labour will continue to pursue controversial reforms if it wins a third term in power the party s election chief alan milburn has said. he pledged labour would encourage more people to achieve their aspirations. what we want is for more people to earn and own mr milburn told bbc radio s today show. tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin called labour a brilliant machine for talking about things but said it did not deliver policies the country needs. meanwhile the liberal democrats president simon hughes said: new labour has lost people s confidence in a way old labour never did. mr milburn told today that labour wanted policies which encouraged increased social mobility in britain. pressed on incapacity benefits he said the tax and welfare system must provide the right incentives to people . no-one is talking about driving people into work but what we do know is there are one million people on incapacity benefit who want the opportunity to work providing the right level of support is there for them . however backbench labour mp karen buck warned against proposed changes in such benefits. she told the today programme: if the policy is seen as being about how do you make the feckless poor go back to work then it is not going to work on the one hand. and it is not going to improve our electoral chances on the other. mr milburn also sought to draw a line under the controversy about reports of a feud between gordon brown and prime minister tony blair. he stressed that mr brown would play the same role that he did in the last election. mr milburn gave more details of planned reforms in a speech to labour s fabian society in which he also praised mr brown as one of the leaders of the party s reform process. in the speech he backed choice in schools and hospitals wider home ownership and changes to the welfare system. mr milburn insisted that government reform must continue. our task is to rebuild the new labour coalition around one nation politics that recognise while life is hard for many all should have the chance to succeed he said. there is a glass ceiling on opportunity in this country. in our first two terms we have raised it. in our third term we have to break it. voters turned on the party when it failed to reform industrial relations in the he also told his audience. oliver letwin said the government had failed to deliver in any of the key public services such as cleaner hospitals discipline in schools and putting more police on the streets. he said ministers had not delivered cleaner hospitals with people dying from infections last year. new labour had failed on school discipline because it had not implemented serious reforms so that teachers could run schools and which would give parents choice he went on. for the lib dems simon hughes said many pensioners are means tested for the money they needed and students who were told there wouldn t be tuition fees and more debt have been given exactly the opposite . he added: under new labour all households are still paying unfair council tax rather than a fairer alternative.
1626,high fuel prices hit ba s profits british airways has blamed high fuel prices for a % drop in profits. reporting its results for the three months to december the airline made a pre-tax profit of £ ($) compared with £ a year earlier. rod eddington ba s chief executive said the results were respectable in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £ or .%. ba s profits were still better than market expectation of £ and it expects a rise in full-year revenues. to help offset the increased price of aviation fuel ba last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers. in october it increased this from £ to £ one-way for all long-haul flights while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £. to £ a leg. yet aviation analyst mike powell of dresdner kleinwort wasserstein says ba s estimated annual surcharge revenues - £ - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £. turnover for the quarter was up .% to £. further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. looking ahead to its full year results to march ba warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. however it said sales would be better than previously forecast. for the year to march the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a % to .% improvement anticipated ba chairman martin broughton said. ba had previously forecast a % to % rise in full-year revenue. it also reported on friday that passenger numbers rose .% in january. aviation analyst nick van den brul of bnp paribas described ba s latest quarterly results as pretty modest . it is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development however operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong he said. since the september attacks in the united states ba has cut jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products mr eddington said. for example we have taken delivery of six airbus aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our club world flat beds. ba s shares closed up four pence at . pence.
1721,tory leader quits legal position david mcletchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role. the scottish conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with tods murray did not influence the causes he supports. but on friday he said: i have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect. mr mcletchie had received advice from holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare. labour said he had cleverly not asked about paid advocacy. a tory spokesman totally refuted any wrongdoing. mr mcletchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for edinburgh airport. the msp had been a partner for tods murray which has a client opposing the development. mr mcletchie did not have a complaint made against him but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. he was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong. explaining his reason for quitting the post mr mcletchie said: i have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with tods murray. however i have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. to avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of tods murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled i have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. i am proud to have been a part of tods murray for the last years and wish it well in the future. labour msp christine may had said mr mcletchie was very clever to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section of the code. he was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section the section on paid advocacy she said. section of the members interest order legally obliges msps to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner . however msps code of conduct recognises a wider definition of parliamentary proceedings including a non-statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices such as motions. but a letter from holyrood s chamber office chief ken hughes also made clear that mr mcletchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. commenting on mr mcletchie s decision to stand down a scottish labour party spokesman said: this should mean mr mcletchie doesn t breach the paid advocacy rules in future. however it doesn t change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past. scottish national party holyrood leader nicola sturgeon accused mr mcletchie of failing to properly serve his constituents. ms sturgeon said: i think this whole episode has been very damaging for mr mcletchie and i m sure he will be reflecting on it. she added that she thought that the tories were an irrelevant party so she would not lose any sleep over it . peter misselbrook executive partner of tods murray said mr mcletchie had been considering retirement later in the year. he added: david has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so.
2174,lifestyle governs mobile choice faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests. instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an in-depth study by telecommunications company ericsson. historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson s consumer and enterprise lab. we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said. we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website. for the study ericsson interviewed mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. people s habits remain the same said dr bjorn. they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it s a much more convenient way to do it. one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people he said. while diaries have always been popular a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. ericsson s research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways. dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago. this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch. another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. only when about % of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it. once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off. dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. however he said now % of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. in the figure was %. similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. in only % of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month. now the figure is %. similar rises have been seen in many other european nations. dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said. digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays. by contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.
99,rapper kanye west s shrewd soul us hip-hop star kanye west - who leads the race for this year s grammys with nominations - rose to prominence by producing songs for artists such as jay-z and alicia keys. he then emerged from his behind-the-scenes role to become an artist as well as a producer. but his solo career almost ended before it began after a near-fatal car crash left west with his jaw wired shut in . the resulting song through the wire became west s first uk hit in april and subsequent album the college dropout became a transatlantic success both critically and commercially. west began rapping as a teenager at his chicago school inspired by the beats and rhymes of pioneers run dmc. hip-hop producer no id encouraged west to sample old soul and r&b hits then revive them with an updated sound an approach that would become his trademark. i feel like a lot of the soul that s in those old records that i sample is in me he said. so when i hear them and i put them with the drums and i bring them to the new millennium it s just like god s doing that. i m one with them records right there. it s a blessing. leaving his chicago art school after only one year - a move which would later inspire the title of his album - west began his music career co-producing songs for artists mase and the madd rapper. this drew the attention of superstar rapper jay-z who signed west up to his roc-a-fella record label to produce numerous artists on his roster. west s work gained mainstream recognition when he produced the singles takeover and izzo (hova) on jay-z s own album blueprint. incorporating samples of five to one by the doors and the jackson five s i want you back respectively the hits were credited with injecting soul back into hip-hop. as their success attracted further production work for jay-z ( bonnie & clyde) and artists such as ludacris (stand up) and alicia keys (you don t know my name) west announced plans for a solo album. driving home from a late-night los angeles recording session in october he was involved in the car crash that left his jaw fractured in three places. anytime i hear about any accident my heart sinks in and i just thank god that i m still here he later said. that steering wheel could have been two inches further out and that would have been it. west s account of the accident sampled chaka khan s hit through the fire to become the heart of his completed solo album the college dropout. released last year it was by turns smooth humorous and sharp and largely avoided the clich& hip-hop preoccupation with guns girls and jewellery. through the wire was quickly joined in the uk and us charts by slow jamz on which west collaborated with rapper twista and ray actor jamie foxx. the college dropout spawned two further uk hits and a string of award nominations. west was shortlisted for grammys - including nominations for artist and album of the year - and took the best hip-hop artist producer and album titles at last year s music of black origin (mobo) awards. now a respected rapper and producer in the influential field of hip-hop kanye west is unlikely to regret his decision to leave college early.
2200,uk pioneers digital film network the world s first digital cinema network will be established in the uk over the next months. the uk film council has awarded a contract worth £. to arts alliance digital cinema (aadc) who will set up the network of up to screens. aadc will oversee the selection of cinemas across the uk which will use the digital equipment. high definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly british and specialist films. most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to screens in up to cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images. the new network will double the world s total of digital screens. cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server. each film is about gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte-size file. fiona deans associate director of aadc said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur. the film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie. people will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches. the picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made - there is no degradation in quality over time. the key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of british films documentaries and foreign language films. access to specialised film is currently restricted across the uk said pete buckingham head of distribution and exhibition at the uk film council. although a genuine variety of films is available in central london and a few other metropolitan areas the choice for many outside these areas remains limited and the digital screen network will improve access for audiences across the uk digital prints costs less than a traditional print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films said ms deans. it can cost up to £ to make a copy of a print for specialist films. in the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that. distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer. the uk digital network will be the first to employ projectors - which are capable of showing films at resolutions of * pixels. a separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in may. the sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs. some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum - they don t need to be shown twice a day explained ms deans. a cinema will often book a print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema. with digital prints every cinema will have its own copy.
742,ref stands by scotland decisions the referee from saturday s france v scotland six nations match has defended the officials handling of the game after criticism by matt williams. the scotland coach said his side were robbed of victory by poor decisions made by the officials. but nigel williams said: i m satisfied the game was handled correctly. meanwhile matt williams will not be punished by the scottish rugby union for allegedly using bad language in his comments about the officials. he denies having done so. nonetheless he was furious about several decisions that he felt denied his side a famous victory. but nigel williams told the scottish daily mail: i spoke to matt williams at the post-match dinner. he made no mention of the disallowed try or any other refereeing decisions whatsoever. if matt has issues with the match officials then he is very welcome to phone me and discuss them. ultimately there is a match assessor at every international game to give an impartial and objective view of the performance of the officials. that is the beginning and end of it.

983,india seeks to boost construction india has cleared a proposal allowing up to % foreign direct investment in its construction sector. kamal nath commerce and industry minister announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting. analysts say improving india s infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. the indian government s decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some indian firms. a spokesman for dlf builders dr vancheshwar told the bbc this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders. he said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice. the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to % will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments. the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board which can be bureaucratic. the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brick-making industries. mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired. foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least square meters ( square feet) within a specific timeframe said mr nath without specifying the timeframe. previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area discouraging some from entering the indian market. this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it. anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis - an international real estate company - told the bbc this was a big positive step. however chittabrata majumdar general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions (citu) said allowing fdi in the country is compromising india s own self reliance . he said no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone. mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.
1342,moreno debut makes oscar mark catalina sandino moreno has joined a rare group of actresses who have been nominated for an oscar for starring in a foreign language film. the colombian-born actress was the final hope for director joshua marston who scoured the us and colombia for a lead for maria full of grace. the film sees the -year-old play a teenage drug mule who smuggles heroin by swallowing pellets in condoms. plaudits have been raining down on her for her gritty performance making it all the more surprising that this is her first film. her previous acting experience was in amateur productions in her home city of bogota at the ruben di pietro theatre academy. she has already received a nomination for the independent spirit awards leading actress category but these rarely overlap with academy awards instead recognising quirkier low-budget films. and at the berlin film festival the jury could not choose between her and charlize theron s oscar winning performance in monster so gave them a tied award. sandino moreno is now being regarded as one of the most promising actresses around at the moment. but she is taking her time committing to her next project hoping to land a strong spanish script and would love to be able to work with directors pedro almodovar or alejandro amenabar.

1384,air passengers win new eu rights air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation. new eu rules set compensation at between euros (£) and euros depending on the length of the flight. the new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights including budget airlines. airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. the european commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the european low-fare airlines association (elaa) and the other from the international air transport association (iata) which has attacked the package as a bad piece of legislation . previously passengers could claim between euros and euros if they had been stopped from boarding. however only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations. the eu decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. overbooking can often lead to bumping - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. when this happens against a passenger s will airlines will now have to offer compensation. in addition if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline all passengers must be paid compensation. however airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to extraordinary circumstances . airlines fear that extraordinary circumstances may not include bad weather security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. all eu-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the eu will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on thursday. low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. it s a preposterous piece of legislation we among all airlines are fighting this ryanair deputy chief executive michael cawley told radio s today programme. the european regions airline association (eraa) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. andy clarke eraa director of air transport said that the ec advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather. ec spokeswoman marja quillinan-meiland conceded there were grey areas but said these are not as big as the airlines are making out . in cases of dispute national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case she said. new technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather she added. the eraa s mr clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. we reckon it s going to cost european air passengers - not the airlines the airlines have no money it has to be paid by passengers - . euros that s over £ a year loaded onto european passengers mr clarke said. that s basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted. on wednesday jacques barrot vice president of the european commission and also commissioner for transport said that the changes were necessary. the boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers right. this is a concrete example of how the union benefits people s daily lives he added. the ec has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.

580,napster offers rented music to go music downloading for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services can be a costly business. the cost of paying even as little as per track can add up particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient and ultimately cheaper way of owning music. music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services said paul myers chief executive of wippit a uk-based music download service. while itunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to ipod owners others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed napster to go in the uk in the next few months. the service can be used on players that support microsoft windows latest digital rights management technology known as janus. this includes players made by samsung rio and creative. currently on offer in beta-version in the us the service costs $ per month for unlimited downloads. the technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play. this has outraged some digital music lovers especially as napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the pc. napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers greater value for customers. mr myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers. we ve been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. format interoperability excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose he said. who wants to download a track that won t play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an ipod or the latest mobile phone wippit offers a download subscription service for £. per month or £ per year. it has a catalogue of around songs.

135,europe backs digital tv lifestyle how people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change following the launch of an ambitious european project. in nice last week the european commission announced its networked & electronic media (nem) initiative. its broad scope stretches from the way media is created through each of the stages of its distribution to its playback. the commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly when on the move at home or at work no matter who supplies the devices network content or content protection scheme. more than experts were in nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as nokia intel philips alcatel france telecom thomson and telefonica. it might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. but again and again speakers stated they could not see incompatible stand-alone solutions working. a long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required. the european commission is being pragmatic in its approach. they have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that nem encompasses. the nem approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline pick out the best bring them together and identify where the gaps are. where it finds holes it will develop standards to fill them. what is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. this is bound to please if not surprise many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the commission will be to identify a solution for different digital rights management (drm) schemes. currently drm solutions are incompatible locking certain types of purchased content making them unplayable on all platforms. with the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally the prize for being the supplier of the world s dominant drm scheme is huge. although entertainment is an obvious first step it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare energy efficiency and control of the smart home. the -year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the ec has been funding for a number of years. simon perry is the editor of the digital lifestyles website which covers the impact of technology on media

1879,file-swappers ready new network legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down. one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january. but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies . in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network. the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised. that file-sharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network. one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to. now the man behind suprnova.org who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed exeem. in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems. like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. there will be no centrally maintained list. this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. an early public version of the software should be available before february. sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development. there were no plans for a linux or mac version. he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. despite suprnova administrator sloncek s involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis. users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream. dr johan pouwelse a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. exeem cannot prevent pollution he said. the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said. studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes. by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that s full of crap like kazaa he said. there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said. mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse. he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. it s hard to compete with free he said. no-one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.

1213,old firm pair handed suspensions celtic s henri camara and nacho novo of rangers have both been suspended for offences missed by the referee in a recent old firm game. both were given automatic one-match bans and additional disciplinary points for their actions. that means novo will miss a further two games because of his prior record. camara will miss one additional game. novo was found guilty of stamping on celtic s stephen pearson. camara was punished for kicking gregory vignal. i m extremely disappointed. i don t know if there s a lot to add to that said rangers manager alex mcleish of novo s punishment. but what i will say is that i m at a loss as to why that incident should be picked up and highlighted when there were so many other incidents during the game. both players will miss this weekend s games when celtic host dundee united and rangers visit kilmarnock unless they decide to appeal. the additional bans come into effect from december meaning camara will also be unavailable for the home game against livingston while novo will miss the meetings with dundee united and dunfermline. an sfa spokesman said: they have seven days to appeal but with matches coming along at the weekend they would need to do so before friday. but if they do appeal it won t be heard before this weekend because it takes a bit of time to seat up an appeals tribunal. meanwhile bob malcolm and rangers have been informed by letter as to the outcome of the hearing regarding his reaction to rangers being awarded a penalty in the same game. malcolm a substitute on the day was taken from the rangers dug-out and spoken to by police about an alleged gesture he made. but the sfa would not detail what if any punishment malcolm would receive. once rangers receive our letter we will be in a position to make a comment on the findings added the spokesman.

156,lomu relishing return to action former all black star jonah lomu says he cannot wait to run out on the pitch for former england rugby union captain martin johnson s testimonial on june. the -year-old had a kidney transplant in july but will play his first full match for three years leading a southern hemisphere side at twickenham. i actually started training three weeks after my operation but i was very limited until a few months ago. now it s basically bring it on! said the giant winger. the match on june will be my first -man game but i have a training schedule which is quite testing and combines with sevens and a whole lot of things said lomu. i have got so much energy since my operation that i train three times a day six days a week. mohammed ali has always been my ideal. coming back to rugby people said you are dreaming but it always starts off with a dream. it s up to you whether you want to make it a reality. opinion has been divided on whether lomu should attempt to return to the game after such a major operation. but when lomu was asked whether he was taking a risk he replied: as much as someone going down the road being hit by a bus. there are a lot of people in the world with one kidney who just don t know it. i have talked this over had a chat with the donor and this is to set my soul at peace and finish something i started in [when he made his all blacks debut]. at his lowest ebb lomu was so ill he could barely walk but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long-term target is to play for new zealand again. the only person who saw me at my worst was my wife he added. i used to take two steps and fall over but now i can run and it is all coming back and a lot more quickly than i ever thought it would. to play for the all blacks would be the highest honour i could get. that is the long-term goal and you have to start somewhere.
1229,newcastle - bolton kieron dyer smashed home the winner to end bolton s -game unbeaten run. lee bowyer put newcastle ahead when he fed stephen carr on the right flank then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross. wanderers hit back through stelios giannakopoulos who ended a fluid passing move with a well-struck volley. but dyer had the last word in a game of few chances pouncing on a loose ball after alan shearer s shot was blocked and firing into the top corner. neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game with plenty of tackles flying in but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by. bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half - keeping out shearer s low shot and dyer s close-range header - but that was the only goalmouth action of note. and it was almost out of nothing that the magpies took the lead on minutes. bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half-way line and striding forward picked out carr to his right. he then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met carr s cross with a downward header into the far corner. bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well. they were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from giannakopoulos. jay-jay okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving kevin davies and gary speed the greek striker found the bottom corner with a first-time strike. the magpies were opened up again before half-time as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post. but the home side survived and they should have re-taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half. fernando hierro cynically chopped down dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through. but the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby and from the resultant free-kick laurent robert curled the ball just wide. bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies. their strategy seemed to be working until the minute. alan shearer s snap-shot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards. - bolton boss sam allardyce i am bitterly disappointed with the result but i am probably more disappointed with the second-half performance. in the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure and our goal matched theirs in quality. i thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half. we allowed them to heap too much pressure on us and in the end we cracked. - newcastle boss graeme souness we deserved the win. we had a really good second half. bolton are a difficult side to play. you have to match them physically first but we did that and then we played some football. we had a slow first minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that. the scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals. newcastle: given carr boumsong bramble babayaro dyer faye bowyer robert (jenas ) ameobi shearer. subs not used: butt harper milner hughes. goals: bowyer dyer . bolton: jaaskelainen hunt (fadiga ) n gotty ben haim candela giannakopoulos okocha (vaz te ) hierro (campo ) speed gardner davies. subs not used: jaidi poole. booked: ben haim hierro. goals: giannakopoulos . att: ref: s dunn (gloucestershire).

972,seamen sail into biometric future the luxury cruise liner crystal harmony currently in the gulf of mexico is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology. as holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes their ship s crew is testing prototype versions of the world s first internationally issued biometric id cards the seafarer s equivalent of a passport. along with the owner s picture name and personal details the new seafarers identity document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder s fingerprints. the cards are due to be issued in february next year in line with the revised un convention on seafarers identity documents of june . tests currently under way in the caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers produced by different companies in different countries are working to interoperable standards. results of the current tests which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities will be published by the international labour organisation (ilo) by the end of november. crystal cruises which operates the crystal harmony is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology. authenti-corp the us technology consultancy has been working with the ilo on its technical specifications for the cards. if you re issued a seafarer s id in your country you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in say my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed authenti-corp s ceo cynthia musselman told the bbc s go digital programme. she said french jordanian and nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new id cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. it aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. the convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor s wellbeing and therefore it says to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. by increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world said ms musselman. it should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are in fact seafarers.
1157,brown ally rejects budget spree chancellor gordon brown s closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a budget giveaway on march. ed balls ex-chief economic adviser to the treasury said there would be no spending spree before polling day. but mr balls a prospective labour mp said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. he was speaking as sir digby jones cbi director general warned mr brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes. mr balls who stepped down from his treasury post to stand as a labour candidate in the election had suggested that mr brown would meet his golden economic rule - with a margin to spare . he said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules. he also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected may election would not affect the labour party s chances of winning. expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in january. if the mpc (the bank of england s monetary policy committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and i m not predicting that they will - i do not believe that this will be a big election issue in britain for labour he told a parliamentary lunch. this is a big change in our political culture. during an interview with bbc radio s today programme mr balls said he was sure mr brown s budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. i don t think we ll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before he said. his assurances came after sir digby jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers skills. his message to the chancellor was: please don t give it away in any form of electioneering. sir digby added: i don t think he will. i have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. stability is the key word - british business needs boring stability more than anything. we would say to him don t increase your public spending don t give it away. but if you are going to anywhere just add something to the competitiveness of britain put it into skilling our people . that would be a good way to spend any excess. mr balls refused to say whether mr brown would remain as chancellor after the election amid speculation he will be offered the job of foreign secretary. i think that gordon brown wants to be part of the successful labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a conservative party that will take britain backwards mr balls told today. prime minister tony blair has yet to name the date of the election but most pundits are betting on may.
288,brown targets oaps and homebuyers gordon brown has doubled the level at which house buyers pay stamp duty to £ as he put the economy at the heart of labour s election campaign. the chancellor also unveiled a one-off £ council tax refund for pensioners and a rise in child tax credit. mr brown put a pint on beer on a bottle of wine and on cigarettes but froze petrol duty until september. the tories called it a vote now pay later budget. the lib dems branded it a sticking plaster for the election. tory leader michael howard predicted the budget would do nothing to help labour s faltering election campaign. this government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems britain faces mr howard told mps. their only answer is to tax to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later. he ended his response with an election challenge to labour saying bring it on . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy attacked mr brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice. how can it be right in britain today that the poorest % pay more in tax as a proportion of their income than the richest % he asked. mr kennedy criticised mr brown for failing to mention the ticking bomb of council tax revaluation saying it was high time the system was replaced by a local tax based on the ability to pay . during his minute speech mr brown told mps he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of .% for . he said his budget struck a balance between tax cuts that are affordable investments that are essential and stability that is paramount . he rejected across-the-board tax cuts in favour of targeted help for families. the child tax credit will rise in line with earnings giving families an extra £ a week. in contrast the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from £ to £ next month. mr brown told mps child benefit would rise to a maximum of £ a week for the first child and £ for two children. despite his giveaways budget documents show mr brown clawed back £ through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies. he also scrapped stamp duty relief for commercial property in disadvantaged areas - a measure brought in just over three years ago. bbc political editor andrew marr suggested the sweeteners were not big enough to have a transforming effect on voters. but trust in mr brown s economic stewardship would be a central election issue he said. mr brown also unveiled plans for a memorial to the queen mother funded through a special coin to celebrate the queen s birthday. other measures include equal tax status for same-sex couples and a deal with the council of mortgage lenders to boost low cost home ownership. the level where people start paying inheritance tax will also rise from £ to £ from april. mr brown said he had met his financial golden rule with a £ surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years. the economy had grown for consecutive quarters he said and was forecast to continue doing so over the next year with a forecast of % to .% in and .% to % in . the first £ of value-for-money savings identified in the gershon review have been achieved the chancellor said. some civil servant posts have been axed and relocated out of the south east of england he added. snp leader alex salmond said mr brown had failed the tartan test as there were no measures to boost the scottish economy. simon thomas of plaid cymru called it a budget for middle england. uk independence party leader roger knapman attacked the plans for pensioners saying they needed more money and the dignity of being allowed to spend it how they want not free bus rides . the green party said the budget was a wasted opportunity for environmental protection adding: brown obviously has an eye on the coming election and has taken his eye off the needs of the planet.
719,india calls for fair trade rules india which attends the meeting of seven leading industrialised nations on friday is unlikely to be cowed by its newcomer status. in london on thursday ahead of the meeting india s finance minister lashed out at the restrictive trade policies of the nations. he objected to subsidies on agriculture that make it hard for developing nations like india to compete. he also called for reform of the united nations the world bank and the imf. palaniappan chidambaram india s finance minister argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order given india and china s integration into the global economy. he said the issue is not globalisation but the terms of engagement in globalisation. mr chidambaram is attending the meeting as part of the group of nations which account for two thirds of the world s population. at a conference on developing enterprise hosted by uk finance minister gordon brown on friday he said that he was in favour of floating exchange rates because they help countries cope with economic shocks. a flexible exchange rate is one more channel for absorbing both positive and negative shocks he told the conference. india along with china brazil south africa and russia has been invited to take part in the meeting taking place in london on friday and saturday. china is expected to face renewed pressure to abandon its fixed exchange rate which nations in particular the us have blamed for a surge in cheap chinese exports. some countries have tried to use fixed exchange rates. i do not wish to make any judgements mr chidambaram said. separately the imf warned on thursday that india s budget deficit was too large and would hamper the country s economic growth which it forecast to be around .% in the year to march . in the year to march the indian economy grew by .%.
1687,immigration to be election issue immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time. but no longer. both labour and the tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns. they have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes. that was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue. but it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or alternatively running scared of addressing the problem. but this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies. the tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the uk. labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue. now home secretary charles clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry and to kick out more failed asylum seekers. that has been attacked by the tories as too little too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the uk. the liberal democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for a europe-wide policy on immigration. but while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before. former union leader sir bill morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers . my concern is that whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate right-wing political parties picking up on statements like `burden to britain will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty . it is precisely that concern - and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far right s racist agenda - that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue. the challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap.
2170,games win for blu-ray dvd format the next-generation dvd format blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival according to its backers. blu-ray backed by firms including sony is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games. the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format. the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound. this offers incredible -like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of . as we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images we have a much greater need for storage richard doherty from panasonic s hollywood laboratories one of the pioneers of blu-ray told the bbc news website. so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today s dvd. a blu-ray disc will be able to store of high-quality data while toshiba s hd-dvd will hold . mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out. when players do come out they will be able to play standard dvds too which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds. but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to blu-ray in the battle for supremacy. gaming is a $ billion industry worldwide so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made. the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies said michael heilmann chief technology officer for vivendi universal. blu-ray offers the capacity performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming. ea a leading games developer and publisher added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations. mr doherty said gamers were ravenous for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles. gamers especially those working on pcs are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures deeper levels for delivering higher-resolution playback. he added: the focus for games moving forward is on increased immersion. gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated models and textures and increasing the resolution increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience. fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. as games move to more photo-real capability the current technology is limiting. they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments said mr doherty. currently graphics-intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation. high-definition dvds will cut down on that need. likewise consoles rely on single discs so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better high-resolution games. blu-ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios such as mgm studios disney and buena vista as well as top technology firms like dell lg samsung and phillips amongst others. while toshiba s hd-dvd technology has won backing from paramount universal and warner bros. the real world benefits (of hd-dvd) are apparent and obvious said jim cardwell president of warner home video. mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd-dvd. both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox but discussions are still on-going. next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data. ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world and runs from to january.

1974,multi-purpose tv aids india two-thirds of the world s population billion people live on $ a year or less. you might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer. but that s not the case. many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a tv. and now an indian-born computer engineer thinks he s come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet. carnegie mellon professor raj reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people. the first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and professor reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might. i come from a village says prof reddy i know what the population is like many of them are illiterate and many of them have other concerns. there nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a pc word processing and powerpoint he said. so it s clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in a village - it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment education telemedicine and access to expert advice. prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach. after all he asked -- what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to million less fortunate indians let alone the billions of poor people around the world instead prof reddy decided to think of those million indians as a potential market. the problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough. it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this prof reddy says. people do this today with television sets. if you go to india and many other countries they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal. why because personalized entertainment has become very important. this hatched a completely new idea. he calls it a pctvt - a personal computer television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine. literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control. on the screen pictures - not words - designate applications like tv voice mail and video e-mail. this dependence on graphics video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs times more power and more memory than one for a phd. prassana rambathla one of prof reddy s graduate students says that when you re talking illiterate you re talking audio and video and that demands exponentially high bandwidth. it can t choke at any point in time and it has to withstand anything no matter what you re pressing. the major part is making it foolproof very tough so that it never breaks he says. the carnegie mellon team says this project is only possible because pcs are now so much cheaper and have built-in audio and video hardware and software. limited trials of the pctvt are due to start this month in the indian state of andhra pradesh. although andhra pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net. prof reddy has teamed up with eric brewer at the university of california at berkeley. the answer says prof brewer is wi-fi. we re looking at the thing you ll see in starbuck s or many other hotspots he says. we re doing a lot of work on long-distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency when the power goes up and down and the links go up and down and the computers you re connected to just get turned off for no reason. prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about $ a month and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities. reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt s other technologies - such as video mail. for example a farmer could use the pctvt s webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer. prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off. the underlying problem he says is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy and improve their health care. and what i m postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them. if i didn t have it it would be an uphill battle. even with the technology it s an uphill battle. but i have a tool. there is hope. i can reach them in ways that have not been possible before. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production
1103,poll idols face first hurdles vote for me - s pop idol style talent contest for would-be politicians - finally hits our screens this week. over the next four days hundreds of potential candidates will be whittled down by a panel of experts and public vote. the winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election which is expected in the spring. but opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics. any of them would make competent mps former independent mp martin bell insisted on bbc radio s today programme. mr bell who will be offering his advice to the contestants on wednesday argues that westminster has its share of odd balls and the show will engage ordinary voters. if it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that he said. but sir bernard ingham margaret thatcher s former press secretary took a less charitable view accusing the programme of corrupting politics . he said the producers would not achieve their aim of re-engaging voters with that bunch of nutters . to give sir bernard his dues monday evening s opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists. among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels. among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on bruce forsyth s birthday and bill oddie for prime minister. the show follows the time-honoured pop idol format with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance. the contestants were given seconds to present their manifestos. then the final were tested on their lobbying ability. they were then cross-examined by the panel which was chaired by ex-itn political editor john sergeant with television host lorraine kelly taking the nicki chapman role. but the real star of the show is kelvin mackenzie in the simon cowell mr nasty seat. the former sun editor dispensed a stream of well-crafted insults and one-liners. his advice for one young contestant was to get a haircut and a brain transplant . wheelchair user kevin donnellon was asked: why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled don t you care about the inuit implored guitar-toting environmental campaigner barry lim. i don t care about them. i care about myself and when the sun s shining i think - fantastic replied mr mackenzie. mr lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes. when the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers mr brown he says well prime minister bad news all the houses in britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax observed mr mackenzie. that was an total disaster. i just couldn t seem to think of things to say a crestfallen mr lim confided in the show s presenter jonathan maitland. irfan hanif a -year-old doctor from bolton made a good impression even if he was a little thrown by mr mackenzie s suggestion that instead of being treated by the nhs young drunks should given a good beating and left to die. dominic carman - son of late libel lawyer george carman - was voted through to the final on a platform of cutting defence spending to boost education. opinion was more divided over rodney hylton-potts a -year-old convicted fraudster. mr mackenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress. he could join the rest of the crooks in the houses of parliament. but ms kelly said she would not trust him as far as she could throw him . the series continues throughout the week with the public given the chance to evict one prospective mp every night. itv will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates.
315,white prepared for battle tough-scrummaging prop julian white is expecting a resurgent wales to give him a rough ride in england s six nations opener in cardiff on saturday. the leicester tight-head is in the form of his life making the england number three shirt his own. but he knows wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny. the welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with he told bbc sport. they have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years. white is also impressed with the welsh pack s strength in depth. gethin jenkins is starting at loose-head for them. he has played a bit at tight-head but i think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good he added. the -year-old has made a massive contribution to the england and leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world. he destroyed south africa s os du randt in the scrum at twickenham last autumn to give england the platform for an impressive - victory. leicester who signed white from bristol when the west country side were relegated from the zurich premiership in the summer of have also been aided by white s presence this season. the tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the heineken cup. i am pleased with my form he said. but my form is helped by the people i play with at leicester - people like martin johnson and graham rowntree. it s been a good season so far and to be in the starting xv for the first game of the six nations is what every player wants. i am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend. white is now one of the more experienced members of the england squad which takes to the field on saturday. injuries have taken their toll and coach andy robinson has been deprived of richard hill jonny wilkinson martin corry mike tindall will greenwood and stuart abbott. and with caps and a world cup winner s medal to his name white is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres matthew tait and jamie noon. i don t know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way he added. when i first came into the squad people like jason leonard and martin johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out. it gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you. i was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good. white missed the vast majority of last year s six nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the event to get going. and that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red-hot atmosphere in cardiff. i enjoy the atmosphere. the millennium stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world he said. to go down there and hear the shouting and the singing - it s one of my favourite places to play. this is probably the most even six nations for a long time. england ireland france and wales are all contenders. on form ireland should be favourites but you just don t know - that s the great thing about this tournament.

1976,mobile music challenges ipod age nokia and microsoft have agreed a deal to work on delivery of music to handsets while sony ericsson has unveiled its phone walkman and motorola is working on an itunes phone. can mobile phones replace the player in your pocket the music download market has been growing steadily since record firms embraced digital distribution. ease of use relative low price and increased access to broadband has helped drive the phenomenal growth of players. full-length music downloads on mobile phones have not taken off so quickly - held back by technical challenges as well as issues over music availability. but the mobile music industry is confident that the days of dedicated players are numbered. gilles babinet chief executive of mobile music firm musiwave said: music downloads on mobiles have the potential to be the biggest-ever medium for music. musiwave provides downloading infrastructure for the mobile phone market and mr babinet said the industry was enjoying definite momentum. but there are hurdles to overcome. mobile phones offer limited storage for music - certainly nothing to rival apple s ipod. but the first mobile phones with hard disk players will be on the market soon and the current generation of mobiles using flash technology can store up to one gigabyte of music - enough for songs. we are working in the hard disk area and we will be bringing out exciting devices jonas guest vice president for entertainment at nokia told the bbc news website. but will mobiles become mere storage devices one of the problems we could have is that mobiles are used just for storage and playback while pcs are used for downloading said mr babinet we don t want people to cast aside their pcs - we want mobile users to hook up into the existing ecosystems explained mr guest. you must enable people to transfer music from a pc to a handset and vice versa. one of the key elements of the nokia and microsoft deal is the agreed ability to transfer songs between a handset and a pc. microsoft will adopt open standards allowing music to cross boundaries for the first time. songs can be downloaded on pc or mobile and transferred between the platforms. the line between online and wireless is going to blur predicted ted cohen senior vice president of digital development and distribution at emi. he said: the market is more regional in its maturity. in asia it is beyond belief. the majority of our digital revenues in asia comes from mobiles. in north america it is fixed line while there is equilibrium in europe. emi currently offers its entire download catalogue for use by both by pcs and mobile phones. mr cohen said: it s going to be just as important to connect through or wireless as it is through your pc. we want music to be a continuum. the seamless experience of mobiles and pc downloads is approaching he predicted. mr babinet said the mobile phone had a number of advantages over pcs which would see it become the focus for music downloading in the future. getting music from your pc onto a device is not an easy experience. you have to switch the pc on load the operating system load the program buy the music download the music and then transfer the music. all of these steps can be done in one step on a mobile phone. he said the mobile phone s billing system would make it easier for teenagers to embrace downloads because pre-paid cards were already accepted by the age group. certainly we have a problem with battery memory and bandwidth. but it s not about the current status. it s about the potential. you will have all of your music on your mobile. all three men said that the social interaction of mobile music would drive the market. mr cohen said: i can send you the song and it is either billed to me or i send it to you and if you listen to it and want to keep it is billed to you. it s a social phenomenon. mr babinet said: today you use radio and tv to discover music. tomorrow you will discover and consume music via one device - the mobile.

1272,vera drake s bafta triumph hope at the bafta film awards on saturday night there is the prospect that a home-grown movie could walk off with a clutch of trophies. vera drake mike leigh s tale about a backstreet abortionist is nominated in categories. these include best film best director and best actress shortlist for imelda staunton who plays the eponymous character. the film has spent months being lauded with prizes from the venice film festival to five awards from the london critics circle on wednesday night. the baftas has a tradition of honouring british cinema and this year vera drake is the obvious candidate to be heaped with praise. empire magazine s reviews editor dan jolin said the film had a very good chance of doing well on saturday predicting that it would collect five or six awards. i don t think it s going to do a lord of the rings-style sweep but imelda staunton is a shoo-in for best actress he said. a best director prize for mike leigh and best british film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavily-nominated competitors the aviator and finding neverland. mr jolin tipped another contender - most likely the aviator - to walk away with the bafta for best film and added that finding neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies. strong oscar contenders million dollar baby and sideways did not figure in the bafta nominations giving vera drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes. there is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back. out of all the films in the running for the baftas vera drake is the true blue british one. if mike leigh is going to win awards for anything it should be vera drake at this year s baftas said mr jolin adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet. mr jolin also tipped phil davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in vera drake but felt that heather craney could be outdone by kate winslet or natalie portman in the supporting actress category. if there is anywhere where this film is going to win it will be at the baftas he said. the guardian s film critic peter bradshaw felt that there might well be a sweep of awards for vera drake on saturday night. i hope that bafta voters will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film. if bafta can t do so what hope is there he said. mr bradshaw felt that mike leigh s masterpiece was entitled to the best film award - leaving dead man s shoes harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban my summer of love and shaun of the dead to slug it out for the best british film trophy. i will be cheering if vera drake wins a whole host of awards he added.

1980,t-mobile bets on pocket office t-mobile has launched its latest pocket office third-generation () device which also has built-in wi-fi - high-speed wireless net access. unlike other devices where the user has to check which high-speed network is available to transfer data the device selects the fastest one itself. the mda iv released in the summer is an upgrade to the company s existing smartphone the ./wi-fi mda iii. it reflects the push by mobile firms for devices that are like mini laptops. the device has a display that can be swivelled and angled so it can be used like a small computer or as a conventional clamshell phone. the microsoft mobile phone with two cameras and a qwerty keyboard reflects the design of similar all-in-one models released this year such as motorola s mpx. one in five european workers are already mobile - meaning they spend significant time travelling and out of the office rene obermann t-mobile s chief executive told a press conference at the trade show in cannes. he added: what they need is their office when they are out of the office. t-mobile said it was seeing increasing take up for what it calls office in a pocket devices with mdas sold in europe already. in response to demand t-mobile also said it would be adding the latest phone-shaped blackberry to its mobile range. reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office it announced it would introduce a flat-fee £ ($) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the uk using its wi-fi hotspots. it said it would nearly double the number of its hotspots - places where wi-fi access is available - globally from to . it also announced it was installing high-speed wi-fi on certain train services such as the uk s london to brighton service to provide commuters a fast net connection too. the service which has been developed with southern trains nomad digital (who provide the technology) begins with a free trial on trains on the route from early march to the end of april. a full service is set to follow in the summer. wi-fi access points will be connected to a wimax wireless network - faster than wi-fi - running alongside the train tracks. brian mcbride managing director of t-mobile in the uk said: we see a growing trend for business users needing to access e-mail securely on the move. we are able to offer this by maintaining a constant data session for the entire journey. he said this was something other similar in-train wi-fi services such as that offered on gner trains did not offer yet. mr obermann added that the mobile industry in general was still growing with many more opportunities for more services which would bear fruit for mobile companies in future. thousands of mobile industry experts are gathered in cannes france for the which runs from to february.

902,mobiles not media players yet mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players say two reports. despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life said jupiter. a separate study by gartner has also said real-time tv broadcasts to mobiles is unlikely in europe until . technical issues and standards must be resolved first said the report. batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer like video playback video messaging megapixel cameras and games amongst others. bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life. fifty percent of europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets. mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready said thomas husson mobile analyst at jupiter research. mobile music services should be new and different and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches. other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones compared to portable players which can hold up to of music. the mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading after the success of apple s itunes napster and other net music download services. with phones getting smarter and more powerful there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move. in the us services like tivo to go let people transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones. but the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. currently tv-like services where clips are downloaded are offered by several european operators like italy s tim and . mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though said the report. various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. in europe trials in berlin and helsinki are making use of terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles hours a day. the service uses technology one of the standards for mobile tv. but at the end of the european telecommunications institute (etsi) formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld (dvb-h) as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe. operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb-h standard. tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too which expects good quality images at low prices according to analysts. people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens said gartner. digital video recorders like europe s sky+ box and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch. as a result people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. more powerful smartphones like the xda ii nokia sonyericsson and the orange offering web access text and multimedia messaging e-mail calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. a report by analysts instat/mdr has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by % over the next five years. it says that smartphones will make up million out of million handsets shipped globally by .
1442,sir paul rocks super bowl crowds sir paul mccartney wowed fans with a live mini-concert at american football s super bowl - and avoided any janet jackson-style controversies. the -year-old sang hey jude and other beatles songs in a -minute set at half-time during the game in florida. last year jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine causing outrage among millions of tv viewers and landing the cbs tv network a fine. sir paul however did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking -year-old sir paul for his second super bowl show. three years ago he was invited to perform at the first super bowl after the september attacks and performed his specially-written song freedom. this time he started off the show at the alltel stadium in jacksonville florida with the beatles numbers drive my car and get back. he then performed a mellow version of live and let die the james bond theme he recorded with the band wings. finally he closed the show with a rousing version of hey jude. the former beatle resisted any temptation to refer to janet jackson s headline-grabbing performance last year instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. the singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second nipple-gate were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath. earlier the black eyed peas and alicia keys had provided the night s other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. black eyed peas singer fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants but nothing in her performance was likely to upset tv watchdogs. after the controversy last year - which saw cbs fined a record $ (£ ) by federal regulators - super bowl organisers had turned to producer don mischer to oversee this year s half-time show. his previous production credits included olympic opening and closing ceremonies. the super bowl is watched by an audience of . million in the us with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. michael jackson aerosmith diana ross gloria estefan and phil collins are among the stars who have previously graced the super bowl stage.
1160,csi shows give unrealistic view people have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the csi tv shows real experts say. evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes at a time when many have large backlogs science investigators claim. lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used. the issue was discussed at a major science conference in washington dc. crime scene investigation (csi) and its spin-offs csi: miami and csi: new york have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the atlantic. each episode a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science - and the extensive resources at their disposal. the csi effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show said max houck who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university us. this tv show comes on and everyone starts watching it - including the cops and prosecutors - and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science (aaas). the american forensics expert said there were roughly - backlogged dna samples in us labs. yet these constituted just % of the total test backlog said dr houck. forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the show s influence in dealing with the families of victims. what i find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case she explained. for example on television the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously. but when people find out that it can take several months they can find that very difficult. dr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people s perceptions. the show s influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom making lawyers jittery. prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because for example they wonder: why wasn t everything tested well in fact not everything needs to be tested dr houck explained. defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that s always accurate. however he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field. my university course started with four graduates in ; we re now the largest major on campus - with students he said. dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: there s more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research.
1737,campbell to be lions consultant former government communications chief alastair campbell will act as a media consultant to sir clive woodward s lions on their tour to new zealand. campbell who left downing street earlier this year will advise on media strategy before and during the tour. i hope i can contribute to the planning and preparation and to ensuring the media and public get the most out of the tour itself he said. i am also looking forward to going out for the later stages of the tour. woodward s decision to call in prime minister tony blair s former spin doctor springs from the deterioration in media relations on the last lions tour of australia in when new zealander graham henry was the head coach. the furore surrounding the newspaper diaries of matt dawson and austin healey was compounded by other disillusioned players venting their frustration through the media. the lions is a massive media event said woodward who will be the head coach. there will be a huge level of interest from the travelling media the fans that will go out in their thousands and the new zealand public. we need to have the strategy and processes in place to deal with the pressures that will bring. [alastair] will act as an advisor both in the build up to and on the tour itself. his role is to work closely with not only myself but (tour manager) bill beaumont (media manager) louisa cheetham and (team manager) louise ramsay. campbell is due to resume working for the government in the new year in the build-up to an anticipated may general election. the lions leave for new zealand on may with the first test match against the all blacks in christchurch on june.
1177,labour mps fears over squabbling if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election. and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party. the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election. as one hugely-disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting: it is time they realised it s not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt. it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand. as paul flynn said: what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times when we wanted to come together we wanted to lead on the global issues to change politics for the next decade the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party two people we greatly respect. stephen pound echoed the message saying: we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve not for the labour party but for this country is the appearance of division. we remember the . they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be named and shamed . the dressing down appears to have done the trick with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn - who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown s stead - and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch. but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things. firstly nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors. even mr prescott admitted that had he still been a backbencher he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message. secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has to all intents and purposes kicked off. but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good - or can even be sustained through the campaign - remains to be seen. even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that while mr brown is in africa for a week the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term. and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be new labour through and through. similarly some were pointing out that the chancellor during the election poster launch once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said. none the less what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp effectively strengthening the prime minister s hand. for example will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister s timing or subject matter as may have been the case in the past what all seem agreed on however is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign. mind you we have heard similar pledges before.
507,gm in crunch talks on fiat future fiat will meet car giant general motors (gm) on tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the italian firm s loss-making auto group. fiat claims that gm is legally obliged to buy the % of the car unit it does not already own; gm says the contract signed in is no longer valid. press reports have speculated that fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim. both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand. the meeting between fiat boss sergio marchionne and gm s rick wagoner is due to take place at gmt in zurich according to the reuters news agency. mr marchionne is confident of his firm s legal position saying in an interview with the financial times that gm s argument has no legs . the agreement in question dates back to gm s decision to buy % of fiat s auto division in . at the time it gave the italian firm the right via a put option to sell the remaining stake to gm. in recent weeks fiat has reiterated its claims that this put is still valid and legally binding. however gm argues that a fiat share sale made last year which cut gm s holding to % together with asset sales made by fiat have terminated the agreement. selling the fiat s car-making unit may not prove so simple analysts say especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to italy s industrial heritage. political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise. we are not expecting fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling gm at this point brokerage merrill lynch said in a note to investors adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business. as far as we are aware the agnelli family which indirectly controls at least % of fiat has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business. fiat may be willing to cancel the put in exchange for money.

240,retail sales show festive fervour uk retail sales were better than expected in november as christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the high street figures show. the office for national statistics (ons) said retail sales rose .% on the month and .% on the year. but the figures along with this week s inflation report could trigger another interest rate rise in the new year. however recent data from the british retail consortium showed a .% slip in high street sales during november. the ons data confounded analyst expectations. many had expected sales to fall slightly in november as shoppers put off buying christmas presents until december. however retailers attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind november s unexpected rise in sales they say. aggressive tactics such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as marks & spencer appear to have paid off. price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn t grown as much as volumes said investec economist david page. the figures sparked a rally for sterling as the data supported the view that it is too early to assume that base rates have peaked.

1928,ukraine strikes turkmen gas deal ukraine has agreed to pay % more for natural gas supplied by turkmenistan. the deal was sealed three days after turkmenistan cut off gas supplies in a price dispute that threatened the ukrainian economy. supplies from turkmenistan account for % of all natural gas imported by ukraine which has large coal deposits but no gas fields. turkmenistan is also trying to strike a similar deal with russia which is not so dependent on its gas. turkmen president saparmurat niyazov who signed the contract said the turkmen side agreed to lower the price demanded by $ per cubic metres bringing it down to $. but the new price is still $ higher than the price fixed in the contract for . the head of the ukrainian state-owned naftohaz company yury boyko said he was fully happy with the deal. on friday turkmenistan acted on a threat and shut off gas supplies to ukraine in attempt to bring the price dispute to a head. mr niyazov said that his government would insist on the same price for supplies to russia. analysts say thay may not happen as russia the world s leading gas producer needs the cheap turkmen gas only to relieve is state-owned gazprom from costly investment in the exploration of oil fields in siberia. turkmenistan is the second-largest gas producer in the world.
1935,lib dems stress budget trust gap public trust in the handling of the economy can only be restored if gordon brown opens up his books for unbiased inspection say the lib dems. city experts say there is a £ black hole in the public finances a claim denied by the chancellor. lib dem spokesman vince cable said the public did not know who to believe and the national audit office should judge. responding to the pre-budget report mr cable also attacked labour s unfair and over-complicated taxes. in his report mr brown insisted he was on course to meet his golden rule of borrowing only to invest rather than for day-to-day spending over the course of the economic cycle. mr cable said people did not know whether to believe the chancellor or the consensus among experts which said the rule would be broken. there is an issue of credibility and trust he said. we cannot have a continuation of a situation where the chancellor sets his own tests and then marks them. what we need is the equivalent of a thorough ofsted inspection of the government s accounts. he asked what the government had to hide. mr cable also accused the chancellor of ducking tough choices. he argued: there are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the uk housing market and rising personal debt. but they have not been confronted. mr brown confirmed he was setting aside another £ for the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan. mr cable compared that new cost with the £ needed for britain s role in the entire first gulf war - when % of the bill had been met through help from european and arab nations. he suggested keeping british troops in iraq could cost another £ with the government also planning to spend at least £ for identity cards. the current economic climate meant britain could not afford the reckless george bush-style tax cutting spree planned by the tories he said. instead what was needed was simple and fair taxation rather than the complete mess produced by mr brown s endless tinkering. mr cable said % of all pensioners were now paying marginal tax rates of %. and one-and-a-half million hard working families were paying % marginal tax rates. with that record he asked why ministers attacked lib dem plans for a new % tax rate for the very rich - those earning more than £ a year. mr brown earmarked £ to help keep down council tax rises next year. but the lib dem spokesman questioned whether that money was being found from cuts to education and health. he urged the government to scrap the grossly unfair tax completely. the lib dems want it replaced with a local income tax. in response mr brown stressed the iraq money came from a reserve funds. it was because he had rejected previous lib dem proposals such as scrapping the new deal that britain s economy was successful claimed mr brown.

597,dvd review: harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban this third harry potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shake-up that really shines on dvd. gone are the warm bright colours found in the two earlier films alfonso cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous - and looks even better here than in the cinema. it is all part of the progression of harry s story into darker areas but you ll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful hogwarts landscape. this is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book. it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted as they always are by a calamity that only harry ron and hermione can put right. it sounds corny. but harry is no longer the winsome hero he is a moody teenager and daniel radcliffe pulls it off very well. emma watson is ever better as hermione and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson. the film itself is the reason to buy this dvd. but it is laden with behind-the-scenes extras including funny if shallow interviews with all the main cast. but what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch. younger viewers will go for the games which include a magic you may have missed memory test and crookshanks chasing off after scabbers. adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes. you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage - and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it as we did on the first harry potter dvd. the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring a scene a short featurette about the making of the film s big moments.

1082,labour battle plan hides blair the tories have accused tony blair of being terrified of scrutiny after labour unveiled details of how it will fight the next general election. in a break with tradition the party will ditch the leader s battle bus and daily press briefings in westminster. instead mr blair will travel to key cities and marginal seats to deliver the party s message. labour election chief alan milburn denied the party was trying to hide the prime minister. he promised the most positive and upbeat election campaign labour has ever run . but tory co-chairman liam fox said labour s plans showed mr blair was terrified of facing proper scrutiny . at a time when the british people are looking for more accountability and openness this government turns its back on them; abandoning plans to tour the country and scared to face journalists in a press conference - it does rather beg the question what have they got to hide the general election is widely expected next may and all the parties are stepping up their campaign preparations. mr milburn said the economy would take centre stage in labour s campaign in what would be a watershed election and the last stand of the thatcherites . mr milburn said labour s slogan would be britain is working - don t let the tories wreck it. the tone of the campaign said mr milburn would be more conversational than rhetorical; more spontaneous less scripted; less national more local and less based on issues and more concentrated on people. the approach is particularly designed to appeal to women voters he said. mr milburn brushed aside questions over why the chancellor was not present at the cabinet meeting to discuss election strategy particularly since such importance was being given to the economy. i m not privy to everybody s diary he said. mr brown has headed labour s preparations for previous polls but mr milburn is taking that role this time. in a break with the past labour will not hold a daily news conference in london. it will not be a battle bus style campaign either he said. in previous elections each party leader has had their own battle bus transporting national newspaper television and radio reporters to staged campaign events around the country. mr milburn said labour s media effort this time would focus more on local newspapers and broadcasters with every local radio station given the chance to interview the prime minister. mr milburn said there would also be a greater effort to set up face-to-face meetings between ministers and the electorate. former downing street media chief alastair campbell is also returning to advise labour on media strategy and campaigning. mr milburn said no decision had been taken yet over whether david blunkett would have a prominent role in the election. liberal democrat chief executive lord rennard suggested labour was avoiding news conferences in london because it wanted less scrutiny of its record and proposals. tony blair seems to have disappeared from labour leaflets and broadcasts he said. in contrast charles kennedy will feature prominently in the liberal democrat campaign right across the country.

1282,uk firm faces venezuelan land row venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez s agrarian reform programme. officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers. the government is cracking down on so-called latifundios or large rural estates which it says are lying idle. the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure. the firm whose agroflora subsidiary operates farms in venezuela insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law. prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted hato el charcote a beef cattle ranch owned by agroflora. according to reuters they plan to seize acres ( hectares) from the acre ( hectare) farm. officials claim that agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. they also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production. the legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus state prosecutor alexis ortiz told reuters. as a consequence the government has taken action. controversial reforms passed in give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the century. critics say the powers - which president chavez argues are needed to help the country s poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. the vestey group said it had owned the land since and would co-operate fully with the authorities. but a spokesman added: agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land. the company pointed out that the farm which employs workers provides meat solely for the venezuelan market. last month the government said it had identified more than idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further . the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had nothing to fear . under president chavez the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state s involvement in the country s economy. it recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state.
876,anglers could face prosecution anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty a committee of mps has warned. sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended the environment select committee said. the mps said they were concerned the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved mps said. they called for a cast-iron guarantee that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation and intends to protect kept animals and companion animals by setting up a duty of care . in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing mutilation of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal s best interest. the environment select committee made recommendations after hearing evidence from organisations and individuals. one was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged - even if they were to later fail. we accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government s intention to exempt fishing as an activity. but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought. however in exempting fishing the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given carte blanche to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity the committee added. the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill such as the law on abandonment of animals which would be significantly weakened . mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences. this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished. committee chairman michael jack said: any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest. this draft bill is no exception. my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn t just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place. but mr jack said the bill very much had the feel of a work in progress and urged the government to guarantee that an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs circuses and game bird farms. the government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to parliament he added.

1815,weak end-of-year sales hit next next has said its annual profit will be £ lower than previously expected because its end-of-year clearance sale has proved disappointing. clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our expectations the company said. the high street retailer said it now expected to report annual profits of between £ and £ ($-). next s shares fell more than % following the release of the trading statement. next chief executive simon wolfson admitted that festive sales were below where we would expect a normal christmas to be but said sales should still top analyst expectations. among areas where next could have done better mr wolfson said menswear ranges were a little bit too similar to the previous year . mr wolfson also said that disappointing pre-christmas sales were more to do with the fact that we went in with too much stock rather than (the fact that) demand wasn t there for the stock . next s like-for-like store sales in the five months from august to december were up .% on a year earlier. this figure is for existing next stores which were unaffected by new next store openings. like-for-like sales growth at the next stores directly affected by new store openings in their locality was .%. overall sales across both its retail and mail order divisions were up .% next said. its next directory mail order division saw sales rise .% during the five-month period. in terms of all the worries about their trading pre-christmas it s a result said nick bubb an analyst at evolution securities. profits of around £ would be well within the comfort zone. however one dealer who asked not to be named told reuters the seasonal sales performance was not what people had hoped for . christmas has been tough for the whole sector and this is one of the best retailers he said. next s trading statement comes a day after house of fraser and woolworths disappointed investors with their figures.

1383,brown comes out shooting labour may have abolished hunting - but that didn t stop chancellor gordon brown using his budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties core election foxes. specifically it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families. in a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre-election boost everyone had been predicting. so if you are a couple with children a pensioner a patient or a youngster there was something pulled from mr brown s red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a new labour government. like a surgeon he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign. the announcements brought great cheers from his own mps who are now in full-on election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps. they obviously believed he had done that for them and coincidentally given his own image as a prime minister-in-waiting another little boost. labour mps for example will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive - a lovely old labour word - this chancellor really is. but gordon brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win labour an historic third term his demeanour remained quiet confident and reassuring. prudence made an appearance albeit towards the end of his address as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to britain and which he claimed would be thrown away by anyone else. according to the opposition parties however it is all one big con trick. as always they accused him of glossing over the facts of the black hole at the centre of his finances which they claim would ensure tax increases after the election. he did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax. as liberal democrat leader charles kennedy claimed for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless. tory leader michael howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re-casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use. he branded it a dodgy vote now pay later budget based on dodgy figures from a dodgy government that gave britain the dodgy dossier. where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering mr howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing mr brown s forecasts to the prime minister s forecasts on iraq s weapons of mass destruction. as ever there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor s red book which sets out the fine detail of his budget in an attempt to spot the flaws. in particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal. and in labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister gordon brown will make at some point after the next election.

708,lloyd s of london head chides fsa the head of lloyd s of london the insurance market has criticised britain s financial watchdog the financial services authority (fsa). in a speech on monday mr prettejohn urged the fsa to force brokers to disclose the size of their commissions. the fsa should change and change now said mr prettejohn who wants it to move from disclosure on request to mandatory disclosure. the call came in a speech on improving the london insurance market. the fsa should not bide their time and wait and see . they should seize the moment mr prettejohn lloyd s chief executive said. the fsa took over regulation of the general insurance sector in january but it sidestepped calls to require brokers to disclose the commissions they earn from insurers to their clients. last week the city watchdog gave brokers and insurers guidance on managing conflicts of interest. brokers must give information on their commissions if and only if their customers request it the fsa said. in the us lack of transparency about brokers commissions has led to problems. the world s biggest insurance broker marsh & mclennan said last week it would pay $ to settle charges raised by new york attorney general eliot spitzer in october that it sought to rig bids in conjunction with insurers. the probe centred around so-called contingent commissions whereby brokers were rewarded according to how much business they brought to an insurer an arrangement that did not always benefit brokers customers. all of the insurance business written in the lloyd s market is placed via brokers.
593,share boost for feud-hit reliance the board of indian conglomerate reliance has agreed a share buy-back to counter the effects of a power struggle in the controlling family. the buy-back is a victory for chairman mukesh ambani whose idea it was. his brother anil the vice-chairman said had not been consulted and that the buy-back was completely inappropriate and unnecessary . the board hopes the move will reverse a % fall in reliance s shares since the feud became public last month. the company has been fractious since founder dhirubhai ambani died in leaving no will. today s round has gone to [mukesh] there is no doubt about it said nanik rupani president of the indian merchants chamber a bombay-based traders body. the company plans to buy back million shares at rupees (£.; $) apiece a premium of more than % to its current market price.
1849,howard rebuts asylum criticisms tory leader michael howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas. mr howard whose parents fled the nazi threat to come to the uk says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. his comments come in a bbc documentary called no more mr nasty . tv presenter anne robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would like to kick your cat . ms robinson a friend of the tory leader also revealed that as a cambridge student mr howard was much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover - although she denied having personal experience. i wasn t at cambridge - and it s not personal experience - but i know people who were. documentary maker michael cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to mr howard for his film portrait. the tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the his parents might not have been allowed into the country. he replies: what is the inference of that that if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you re not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants that seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition it would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister. ms robinson who presents the weakest link tells cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in john major s government. i used to have to sit on my hands because he d get on television and give a passable impression of someone who d like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. i mean it was very very draconian. the film shows mr howard laughing at rory bremner s impression of him as dracula which he calls good fun apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the uk. the film shows the private side of the tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife ex-model sandra. asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses: yeah it would be more enjoyable if i could win occasionally too but otherwise it s quite fun. former downing street communications chief alastair campbell now working on labour s election campaign says a touchy-feely image does not fit mr howard. he says tony blair was not worried by his opponents early performance in their commons clashes because mr howard lacked a big strategy including on issues like iraq. the tory leader brands such criticisms as absolutely rubbish arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of mr blair s failure to tell the truth on intelligence. former tory chancellor ken clarke says mr howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the tory party than his personal image. mr clarke says the party is improving and it is conceivable it could win the next election. but he adds: it has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal. - michael howard: no more mr nasty is being shown on on saturday february at gmt.
1038,apple makes blogs reveal sources apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products. the bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in december following online articles about apple s asteroid product. now apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit. a lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters. apple s lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the asteroid music product and leaking them to the powerpage apple insider and think secret websites. all three are apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products. apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value. the lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the power page and apple insider sites. the separate legal fight with think secret has yet to be resolved. in the ruling handed down this week by santa clara county superior court judge james kleinberg apple can now get its hands on e-mail records from the bloggers net providers. in making his ruling judge kleinberg said that laws covering the divulging of trade secrets outweighed considerations of public interest. california has so-called shield laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest. the judge wrote: ...it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of hits on a website about apple have and will happen. but an interested public is not the same as the public interest . judge kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists too. the electronic frontier foundation which is acting as legal counsel for power page and apple insider said the ruling had potentially wide implications. anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling said eff lawyer kurt opsahl. mr opsahl said the eff was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and us federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e-mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent.

162,custody death rate shocks mps deaths in custody have reached shocking levels a committee of mps and peers has warned. the joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable with mental health drugs or alcohol problems. members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons police cells detention centres and special hospitals. there was one prison suicide every four days between and mps said. the report which followed a year-long inquiry by the committee found the high death rate amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group . many of those who ended up taking their own lives had presented themselves to the authorities with these problems before they even offended the report said. it questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided. increased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term the report said. committee chairman labour mp jean corston said: each and every death in custody is a death too many regardless of the circumstances. yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives. these highly vulnerable people are being held within a structure glaringly ill-suited to meet even their basic needs. crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before. the misplaced over-reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered. until we change our whole approach to imprisoning vulnerable people we cannot begin to meet our positive obligations under article of the european convention on human rights and meet our duty of care to them. the committee also highlighted deeply worrying cases of children and young people taking their own lives. between and children have taken their own lives in prison and two have died in secure training centres. it picked out the case of joseph scholes who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in stoke heath young offender institution in march and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry. it revealed that two weeks before his court appearance for a series of robberies the -year-old was depressed exhibiting suicidal tendencies and slashed his face with a knife about times. even though the trial judge had been alerted to his experience of sexual abuse and mental illness he was sentenced to a two-year detention and training order. nine days into his sentence joseph hung himself from the bars of his cell window with a sheet.

1481,tories would cut number of mps the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one-fifth if they were elected tory leader michael howard has said. the plan forms part of the party s smaller government bill to be unveiled later this week. mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. and he said a referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly. the changes would all take place within five years of the conservatives winning a general election mr howard told the paper. the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum but it would probably mean a reduction of around from the current total of . if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps. mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall - labour by more than and the tories by almost - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced but what about ministers parliament and special advisers he said. shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said: this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people s lives by reducing the size and role of the state . mr howard said the plan would also even out the great unfairness of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england. the average size of an english constituency was people mr howard said. in northern ireland it was just over in wales just over and in scotland . the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom if the assembly was scrapped. mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next. you have got to have a big bang. we don t want this like the house of lords reform getting to one stage and then not having the next stage.

442,scotland - italy six chris paterson penalties gave scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against italy at murrayfield. coach matt williams side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led - at the break. paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and scotland were denied a try when wing sean lamont s touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. a late andrea masi try was small consolation for italy chasing their first away win in the six nations. scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick - lead through the boot of full-back paterson. but the more powerful azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life. a series of drives into scottish territory set up a penalty attempt missed by full-back roland de marigny and a wayward drop-goal effort from luciano orquera. scotland defended the initial thrusts but on minutes italy after coming up yards short of the line equalised through a de marigny penalty. italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the left-footed de marigny pushed his kick wide. scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in a ruck. as the half wore on both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties and the period fizzled out with scotland numerically if not psychologically on top. italy s de marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. and scotland capitalised with a third paterson penalty on minutes. williams side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and after a couple of probing attacks paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap. with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from paterson. another paterson penalty on minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. but john kirwan s men had the last laugh when gordon ross attempted clearance was charged down and masi pounced for the try converted by de marigny. : c paterson; s webster a craig h southwell s lamont; d parks c cusiter; t smith g bulloch (capt) g kerr; s grimes s murray; s taylor j petrie a hogg. r russell b douglas n hines j dunbar m blair g ross b hinshelwood. r de marigny; mirco bergamasco c stoica a masi l nitoglia; l orquera a troncon; a lo cicero f ongaro m castrogiovanni; s dellape m bortolami (capt); a persico d dal maso s parisse. g intoppa s perugini ca del fava s orlando p griffen r pedrazzi kp robertson.
87,chinese dam firm defies beijing the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams the chinese state press has said. the builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam said the beijing news. the xiluodu dam is one of such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. the beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. the firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant. so far only of the construction projects targeted by china s state environmental protection agency (sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order. the china three gorges project corp could now face a fine up to yuan ($ ; £ ). last week it denied that its projects violated regulations. the three gorges corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law it said. the sepa order comes as the chinese government appears to be trying to cool the country s booming economy. previously it has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories into part-time working last year. in china increased its generating capacity by .% to megawatts (mw). the xiluodu dam is designed to produce mw of electricity and is being built on the jinshajiang - or river of golden sand as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. it is a sister project to the main three gorges dam downstream where more than half a million people have had to be relocated drawing criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.
1004,critics back aviator for oscars martin scorsese s the aviator will win best film at the oscars according to the uk s leading movie critics. but several of those surveyed by the bbc news website think the veteran film-maker will lose the best director prize to clint eastwood. most of the critics tipped jamie foxx and hilary swank to scoop best actor and actress for ray and million dollar baby respectively. the jury comprised experts and critics from the top uk film publications. the panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to win. all expect the aviator to win best film but many think it will be a close race between scorsese s howard hughes biopic and eastwood s boxing drama million dollar baby. the other films nominated are wine comedy sideways factual drama finding neverland and ray charles biopic ray. i m pretty sure this is the year of the aviator though my own choice would be sideways said the observer s philip french. sideways should win but it doesn t have a hope said jamie graham of total film a position shared by film presenter jonathan ross. the form going in to the oscars points to the aviator but i liked million dollar baby more said tim dams news editor of trade weekly screen international. five of the eight critics tipped scorsese to win best director with mr dams heat s charles gant and empire s angie errigo plumping for eastwood. sideway s alexander payne ray s taylor hackford and british director mike leigh - nominated for period drama vera drake - are considered outsiders in this category. up until recently i could have sworn scorsese would get it just for being scorsese ms errigo told the bbc news website. but i m beginning to think eastwood will get it. i d be very happy for mike leigh to win but i don t think he has any chance said charles gant film editor of heat. foxx s portrayal of ray charles has already seen him win prizes at the golden globes baftas and screen actors guild awards. mr dams said this made him out-and-out favourite to be named best actor on oscar night. everyone would be incredibly surprised if he didn t win he said. if you re a betting man he s as close as you get to a certainty. if paul giamatti was nominated for sideways it would be a different game says total film s jamie graham. but foxx will and should win. with vera drake star imelda staunton nominated for best actress alongside kate winslet britain has a good chance of victory - on paper. jonathan ross for one will be very happy if winslet wins for eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. but while wendy ide of the times still thinks staunton has a chance heat s charles gant believes her bafta win will cut little ice with academy voters. i d like staunton to win but her chances are not that great said mr gant who predicted a second oscar for hilary swank. i think swank will win said mr french. imelda has got as far as she s going to get playing that role. staunton is also the personal choice of steven gaydos executive editor of industry magazine variety. but while he tipped swank to win he predicted it would be a close contest. everything has the ability to flip by one vote and go the other way he told the bbc news website. there s not a sense that it s obvious how it s going to go. meanwhile thousands of people have voted in a bbc radio five live poll to find the best film never to have won a best picture oscar. the audience voted overwhelmingly for the shawshank redemption the frank darabont tale of hope and humanity which received % of the online votes and % of the text messages. the other two finalists citizen kane and a matter of life and death split the remaining votes roughly equally. this year s academy awards will be shown in the uk by sky movies at gmt on monday. - tim dams screen international: film - the aviator;

632,us woman sues over ink cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp) saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. the unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february . hp the world s biggest printer firm declined to comment on the lawsuit. hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. but the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer the suit said. the lawsuit is asking for restitution damages and other compensation. the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last months. the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as £ but it could cost up to £ in running costs over an -month period due to cartridge a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year. the inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the uk s office of fair trading (oft) which concluded in a report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers.
1372,costin aims for comeback in jamie costin should be paralysed. he says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the olympic stadium in athens for the walk. there is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry driving on the wrong side of the road had ploughed into his rental car. i was in a lot of pain and i guessed that one of my toes was broken says the waterford man. but i was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. in my back it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but i was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully i d be able to race. it took over hours before jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second olympics. my back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae the bottom part had exploded so i m fierce lucky not be paralysed. i d fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake. jamie didn t finally arrive at hospital in athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident. for the first nine hours i had no pain killers which was ridiculous in degrees heat. but once i got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking: ok i ve got a different set of circumstances now . within three days he was arriving back in ireland by air ambulance. doctors in athens had wanted to operate on jamie s back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. the greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. that would have fused all my lower back and i would never have been able to race again. they were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. but when i got to the mater in dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. the people at the mater have been absolutely fantastic. jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back. he then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on january. walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery. physio sessions with johnston mcevoy in limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it s very effective. needles get put right close up to my spine. a two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and i m fairly incapacitated today as a result. jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the polish training centre in spala where he has trained with triple olympic champion robert korzeniowski over the past five years. i was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. basically there s a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing. jamie heads to poland again on sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. all these sessions are small steps on the way to what jamie hopes will be a return to racing in . it s all about trying to get mobility in my back. lying down for three and a half months didn t really help with the strength. there s a lot of work involved in my recovery. i m doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. i m also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. i m fairly full on with everything i do. i d hope to be training regularly by march. but training is just part of the process of getting back. at the moment every time i go and do a big bit of movement my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. it s a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. hopefully after four or five months my back won t tighten up as much.
1803,super size me wins writers award super size me director morgan spurlock has won the writers guild of america s award for documentary feature writing. the oscar-nominated film followed spurlock as he ate only mcdonald s fast food for an entire month. spurlock was given the award at a special ceremony at the roosevelt hotel in hollywood on tuesday. organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time. producer brian grazer presented the award to spurlock and the film s backers roadside attractions samuel goldwyn films and showtime independent films. spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but mcdonald s for a month upgrading to supersize portions when offered. the film followed his weight gain and the health effects on his body including his liver and cholesterol levels. mcdonald s announced it was to scrap its supersized meals last year but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by spurlock s film. spurlock was given his award on the same day the european court of human rights ruled that two uk activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a mcdonald s libel action. helen steel and david morris from north london dubbed the mclibel two were found guilty in a trial of libelling the company in a leaflet they had been handing out at the end of the case the high court in london ruled mcdonald s had been libelled and awarded the company £ in damages later reduced to £ on appeal. but he found the leaflet was true in some aspects.

144,blind student hears in colour a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps. victor wong a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. to study space weather mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. a number of solutions were tried including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille. mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work. the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself mr wong told the bbc news website. for the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images. he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. in order to have an exact reference to the screen a pen and tablet device is used. the software then assigns one of piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally. if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it it wouldn t work that well. mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a colour memory makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears. the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images.
1894,eu software patent law faces axe the european parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented. politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. the bill was backed by some hi-tech firms saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile. hugo lueders european director for public policy at comptia an umbrella organization for technology companies said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would european inventors prosper. he said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. but opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. the proposed law had a troubled passage through the european parliament. its progress was delayed twice when polish meps rejected plans to adopt it. also earlier this month the influential european legal affairs committee (juri) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of meps. to become law both the european parliament and a qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. the latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the eu for re-consideration.

(£) in latest figures show. the commerce department said the trade deficit for all of last year was .% above the previous record - s imbalance of $.. the deficit with china up .% at $ was the largest ever recorded with a single country. however on a monthly basis the us trade gap narrowed by .% in december to £.. the us consumer s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars and even wine and cheese reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of president bush s economic policies. democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. for example they believe china s currency policy - which us manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as % - has given china s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against us competitors. meanwhile the bush administration argues that the us deficit reflects the fact the america is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world spurring on more demand for imported goods. some economists say this may allow an upward revision of us economic growth in the fourth quarter. but others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets which may in turn harm growth. for all of us exports rose .% to $. trillion but imports rose even faster by .% to a new record of $. trillion. foreign oil exports surged by .% to a record $. reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. imports were not affected by the dollar s weakness last year. we expect the deficit to continue to widen in even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend said economist marie-pierre ripert at ixis.

1218,whitehall cuts ahead of target thousands of civil service jobs have already been cut or moved out of london as part of a major cost-cutting drive. chancellor gordon brown said jobs had gone while were being moved out of the south east. he plans to axe jobs to free up money for education health defence housing and overseas aid. unions oppose the plans but mr brown said £ savings had already been made and more jobs had been cut than had been expected at this stage. a further jobs at the department of the environment food and rural affairs have been earmarked to be cut. at the department for work and pensions jobs are to go will be lost by the end of the month at the department of trade and industry and are to go at the inland revenue and customs. in his budget statement the chancellor said the first civil service jobs had been cut on target. about civil servants will leave london and the south east by the end of march and there are plans to relocate another . of those department of health posts will go to yorkshire while hundreds at the department of culture will move to birmingham and newcastle. mr brown also announced plans to merge agencies into nine - described by one civil service union as a bonfire of the quangos . mark serwotka the leader of the public and commercial services union said: in last year s budget we had the day of the long knifes as the chancellor kicked off the crude game of who could cut the most civil service jobs between the government and the tories. there was a time when the only worry thousands of hard working civil and public servants had on budget day was whether petrol or taxes would go up nowadays the worry is whether they will have a job by the end of it. he said mr brown had made welcome announcements on closing tax loopholes and extending the new deal while cutting the very people who deliver them. the treasury also announced plans to reduce the number of public sector workers on sick leave with a new system of checks and tougher measures against those suspected of abusing the system.
1520,umaga ready for lions all blacks captain tama umaga has warned the british and irish lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour. but umaga in england for saturday s irb rugby aid match also backed new zealand to win the three-test series against the lions. he told bbc sport: it s potentially the most fearsome line-up i ve ever come up against. they re awesome. but i d back us all the way to beat them when they come over. lions boss sir clive woodward is set to announce his squad for the june-july tour next month. when woodward was appointed last year it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former england players. but umaga said: he d be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the six nations. don t get me wrong england have got a lot of talented guys and i m sure there are some of them who ll make the lions test xv. but you can t disguise wales and ireland in particular. some of the tries they ve scored have been great. i ll admit it ll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of brian o driscoll. umaga will meet o driscoll in saturday s rugby aid match at twickenham with the irish captain leading the northern hemisphere side. o driscoll is among a host of players in the northern hemisphere squad coached by woodward that are tipped for lions call-ups. it ll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys although a lot can change between now and june umaga said. the -year-old admitted interest in the lions tour was immense calling it the biggest thing to hit new zealand since lord of the rings . he added: as players it s enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the lions. in fact it s not just us all blacks - it s the talk of the country. umaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of saturday s charity game which features a host of big names including george gregan andrew mehrtens and chris latham. but he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. the second [southern hemisphere coach] rod macqueen made the approach i didn t hesitate. it was great when new zealand rugby then gave me the all clear. thankfully i didn t know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn t miss all the horrific reports on the news. there are so many people that were affected are still affected and will be affected for a long time. it s just good to know we can do something minor to help out. - the match will be televised on bbc one at gmt on saturday.
1010,gadget show heralds season partners of those who love their hi-tech gear may want to get their presents in early as experts predict a gadget shortage this christmas. with apple s ipod topping wish lists again there may not be enough ipod minis to go round predicts oliver irish editor of gadget magazine stuff. the ipod mini is likely to be this year s tracey island said mr irish. stuff has compiled a list of the top gadgets for and the ipod is at number one. for anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market stuff and what hi-fi are hosting a best-of gadget show in london this weekend. star of the show will be sony s qrio robot an all-singing all-dancing football-playing man-machine who can even hold intelligent conversations. but he is not for sale and sony has no commercial plans for the robot. he will greet visitors and is flying in from japan. he probably has his own airplane seat that is how highly sony prize him said mr irish. also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface. the event will play host to a large collection of digital music players from companies such as creative sony and philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable ipod from apple. suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless christmas are unlikely to come true as players remain the most popular stocking filler said mr irish. demand is huge and apple has promised that it can supply enough but people might struggle to get their hands on ipod minis said mr irish. for those who like their gadgets to be multi-talented the gizmondo a powerful gaming console with gps and gprs that also doubles up as an player movie player and camera could be a must-have. what is impressive is how much it can do and how well it can do them said mr irish. this christmas gadgets will not be an all-male preserve. women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves said mr irish. gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks.
514,net regulation still possible the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation watchdog ofcom has said. content on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tv-quality video online becomes a norm. at a debate in westminster the net industry considered the options. lord currie chairman of super-regulator ofcom told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. despite having no remit for the regulation of net content disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. at the debate organised by the internet service providers association (ispa) lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation. the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves he said. adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or self-regulation which is currently the practice of the net industry will be up for discussion. some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net. more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. bt has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as bskyb itv and the bbc. head of the division andrew burke spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. how risque can i be in this new age with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners surely i can push it to the limit he said. in fact he said if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them mere conduits back in . this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. richard ayers portal director at tiscali said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. huge changes are afoot in he predicted as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net. the bbc s planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions he said. one of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee said mr ayers. as inappropriate net content most obviously pornography viewed by children continues to dominate the headlines internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan liberal democrat spokesman on it. mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of impossible to regulate and just apply offline laws online . in fact instead of seeing regulation brought online the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content. after lord currie departed the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. if content is on-demand consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them then it is the consumers choice to watch it. there is no watershed on the net said mr burke.
2062,will the budget bring out smiling voters as tory spokesman oliver letwin said - any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners wouldn t he. and everyone does indeed expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of may. there will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways. but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the election. and there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week s budget. the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core labour voters in the fold while ensuring the middle england voters who gave tony blair two election victories don t desert him at the third poll. and needless to say there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr brown s own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third win. but there is a shadow hanging over this pre-election performance - in the shape of £ billion or thereabouts. that is the size of the financial black hole the tories backed by some independent forecasters believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election. the opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash. it was immediately denied but the tories remain suspicious claiming that as mr letwin said if the money does not come from there where will it come from. mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election should labour win. previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong he will argue while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have a sound economy low unemployment and high public spending. the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound increase spending and cut taxes at the same time. the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy but based on increased taxes to fund spending and amongst other things abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax. and there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies. but probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years. and it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election.
320,madagascar completes currency switch madagascar has completed the replacement of its malagasy franc with a new currency the ariary. from monday all prices and contracts will have to be quoted in the ariary which was trading at to the us dollar. the malagasy franc which lost almost half its value in is no longer legal tender but will remain exchangeable at banks until . the phasing out of the franc begun in july was intended to distance the country from its past under french colonial rule and address the problem of the large amount of counterfeit francs in circulation. it s above all a question of sovereignty reuters quoted a central bank official as saying. it is symbolic of our independence from the old colonial ways. since we left the french monetary zone in we should have our own currency with its own name. the ariary was the name of a pre-colonial currency in the indian ocean island state.

2115,cabs collect mountain of mobiles gadgets are cheaper smaller and more common than ever. but that just means we are more likely to lose them. in london alone over the past six months more than mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs according to a survey. that works out at about three phones per cab. over the same period almost laptops and pdas such as palms and pocket pcs were left in licensed cabs. even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets. jemima khan reportedly left her ipod phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be hugh grant. as the popularity of portable gadgets has grown and we trust more of our lives to them we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers. the numbers of lost laptops has leapt by % in the last three years. this has left londoners or those travelling by cab in the capital as the world s best at losing laptops according to the research by the licensed taxi drivers association and pointsec a mobile-data backup firm. more than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in london as in any of the nine other cities (helsinki oslo munich paris stockholm copenhagen chicago and sydney) where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. by contrast danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in germans norwegians and swedes. top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data - enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details. given that few people back up the data on their pc it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. you could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else. equally phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to. this growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny shiny expensive one they have just lost. briton s growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the mobile equipment national database that lets you register the unique id number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen. according to statistics % of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles. millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as transport for london regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. for the drivers finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found. the survey of what else has been left behind included a harp a dog a hamster and a baby.
1638,a november to remember last saturday one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world. that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham. but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion with australia s triumph in london followed by france s capitulation to new zealand. clearly there is no number one side in the world at the moment declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney. there are four five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about %. while that bodes well for rugby as a whole it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade. while the wallabies all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super matters in the new year europe s finest have less than weeks before they return to the international fray. and for the first time in more than a decade it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title. that owes much to ireland s continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays. who secured a first triple crown in years last season could go one better and win their first five/six nations title since . they start with away games against italy and scotland before england and france come to lansdowne road. their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland s self-belief while ronan o gara s late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie o sullivan s side can now close out tight games. not that england or france who have won nine of the last six nations titles between them will lay down quietly. dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio they still have the personnel to prosper. the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden but the fresh shoots of post-world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson. a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff a fourth title in six years is within reach. are in familiar revival territory but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style. while south africa s over-confidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory. if mike ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february. the last fortnight has left in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia. a stunning defeat to argentina their first loss since the world cup could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency. but the manner of new zealand s - demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard. fortunately for the french the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining in paris. after two reasonable performances against australia the scots humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent. while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts. who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship. as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february.
361,us woman sues over cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp) saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. the unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february . hp the world s biggest printer firm declined to comment on the lawsuit. hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. but the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer the suit said. the lawsuit is asking for restitution damages and other compensation. the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last months. the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as £ but it could cost up to £ in running costs over an -month period due to cartridge a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year. the inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the uk s office of fair trading (oft) which concluded in a report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers.
1252,blinx sequel purrs nicely the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft s then new xbox console. its sharp graphics and novel gameplay with the main character able to pause slow rewind and fast-forward time were meant to lure many fans to the new machine. but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half-way through a level without the required tools to finish. thankfully the sequel has fixed many of the original faults. this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters. the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game. as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions pig and feline assuming the role of your created characters. the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal. as in the original your feline persona can control time but this time the pigs get to control space. there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps space bubbles and void traps in order to progress. the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr-style icons and is quite intuitive. annoyingly the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them. the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on and so there are a number of combat elements. these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair. but the game s excellent graphics easily the best-looking platform game around sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans. blinx is out on xbox now.
279,paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday s epic in paris and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris. welsh legend mervyn davies a member of two of three grand slam-winning sides of the hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades . martyn williams wales two-try scorer on the day called it one of the most surreal games i have ever played in . a crestfallen france coach bernard laporte simply observed: there was a french half and there was a welsh half . and what a half it was for the red dragonhood transforming a - half-time deficit into an - lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. but while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this welsh side. that they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time then reverse it on the resumption was remarkable enough. but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve. in international rugby any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. ten of the on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced - in paris two years ago. but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the world cup wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place. the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class noted coach mike ruddock. the likes of michael owen gethin jenkins dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer s lions tour to new zealand. and players like stephen jones martyn williams shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. jones after his superb man-of-the-match display observed that we are a very happy camp now . ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. the joie de vivre so evident in that magical second-half spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the . if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. similarly wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches and that forward power mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. so on to murrayfield where wales have not won on their last three visits. while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive the players will set about the task of beating scotland. only then - with the visit of ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the and writing their own names into welsh legend.
875,sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. sun grid costs users $ () for an hour s worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. so-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed said sun s chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour he asked in a webcast launching sun s quarterly network computing event in california. the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil gas and financial services industries. some of them want to book computing capacity of more than processors each sun said. mr schwartz ran a demonstration of the service showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. hundreds of servers were used simultaneously working on the problem for a few seconds each. although it only took a few seconds the experiment cost $ (£.) because it had used up hour s worth of computing power. the sun grid relies on solaris the operating system owned by sun. initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by sun.

2101,abbas will not tolerate attacks palestinian leader mahmoud abbas has said he will not tolerate attacks such as last friday s suicide bombing in the israeli city of tel aviv. in an interview ahead of a meeting in london to discuss palestinian reforms mr abbas said such attacks were against palestinian interests. the palestinian authority (pa) was exerting a % effort to end the violence mr abbas added. the attack which killed five was the first of its kind since he took office. mr abbas confirmed israel shared information with the pa in the hunt for the organisers of the attack. the israeli government refuses to accept syria s denials that it was implicated in the nightclub bombing. israeli officials gave an intelligence briefing to foreign ambassadors on monday explaining syria s alleged involvement. british foreign minister jack straw said there had been a continuing stream of information suggesting palestinian militant groups were operating from within syria. in an email interview in the british newspaper the independent mr abbas said: we believe peace is possible now and we are ready to negotiate with israel to reach a true and lasting peace based on justice and international legitimacy. he added: we have an opportunity and it would be irresponsible if we the israelis or the world allow it to slip away. tuesday s meeting on palestinian reform is being hosted by british prime minister tony blair. also due to attend are us secretary of state condoleezza rice un secretary general kofi annan world bank officials and foreign ministers from european and arab countries. the conference was a vital step in renewing the peace process mr straw said. it s a high-level attendance which reflects the sense of momentum and opportunity created by recent events he added. a spokesman for mr blair said the prime minister expected the conference to discuss a comprehensive co-ordinated and above all practical work plan for both the palestinian authority and the international community . israel will not attend but is said to be closely watching the outcome.
1595,no charges against tv s cosby us comedian bill cosby will not face charges stemming from an allegation of sexual misconduct. authorities in philadelphia said they found insufficient evidence to support the woman s allegations regarding an alleged incident in january . the woman reported the allegations to canadian authorities last month. cosby s lawyer walter m phillips jr said the comedian was pleased with the decision. he looks forward to moving on with his life he said. district attorney bruce l castor jr who was in charge of the case said that detectives could find no instance where anyone complained to law enforcement of conduct which would constitute a criminal offence. he also said that the fact the woman waited a year before coming forward and she had had further contact with cosby during that time were also factors in his decision. the unidentified woman s lawyer dolores m troiani said her client was likely to sue the comedian. i think that s the only avenue open to her. she felt as we did that it s a very strong case and she was telling the truth. she also said that the woman supplied further evidence to prosecutors that she believed strengthened her allegations. cosby emerged as one of the first black comics to have mainstream success in the us. he was a successful stand-up before hosting the children s show fat albert and the cosby kids and starring in the cosby show one of the biggest sitcoms of the .
1168,redknapp poised for saints southampton are set to unveil harry redknapp as their new manager at a news conference at gmt on wednesday. the former portsmouth boss replaces steve wigley who has been relieved of first-team duties after just one win in league games in charge. redknapp quit his fratton park position on november and vowed: i will not go down the road - no chance. pompey coach kevin bond is poised to join redknapp who will be saints third boss of the season. redknapp s first game in charge will be at home to middlesbrough on saturday. portsmouth chairman milan mandaric said he was disappointed by the news and claimed redknapp had been in talks with southampton for some time . it would appear that negotiations over this have been going on for some time mandaric said on portsmouth s official website. i am surprised and a little shocked that the chairman of southampton has not picked up the phone and kept me informed. according to mandaric redknapp vowed he would not join their south coast rivals when he left portsmouth. i said to harry i hope you don t go to southampton and he told me absolutely not he said. i m wouldn t say i m bitter disgusted or angry just disappointed but it s harry s life and it s his decision. redknapp became a cult hero after leading portsmouth into the premiership for the first time and then masterminding their survival in their debut season. but he left the club claiming he needed a break from football though many believed he was upset with mandaric s decision to bring in velimir zajec as executive director. southampton chairman rupert lowe was desperate to give former academy director wigley who replaced paul sturrock just two games into the season every chance to succeed at st mary s. but results under wigley have been poor and southampton are deep in trouble near the foot of the table. when redknapp s appointment is confirmed he will be saints ninth manager in eight years.

2127,dunne keen to commit to man city richard dunne is ready to commit his long-term future to manchester city after turning his career around. he was once threatened with the sack by city boss kevin keegan but has since responded with impressive performances prompting interest from other clubs. early talks have taken place and the defender said: hopefully something will be sorted out as soon as possible. i definitely want to stay at city because i have really improved as a player here. newcastle boss graeme souness is said to have been impressed enough by dunne s turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the january transfer window. but the -year-old dubliner underlined his intention to stay at eastlands. he added: it s nice to be linked with top clubs but the important thing is this one and what we do. i really enjoy it at city and i want to keep that going. keegan is expected to be told there will be no funds to bring in fresh faces in january. dunne s professionalism was famously questioned by keegan who ordered the defender home after he allegedly turned up for training in a dishevelled state. but dunne is keen to put that period of his life behind him and said: i ve grown up a lot and the manager sees me as one of the most experienced players in the squad. i ve played more games than any other outfield players this season so i can t be regarded as being a kid any more. i have to use that as added pressure to perform and apart from the games at newcastle and middlesbrough defensively we ve done quite well. keegan is set for another boost when goalkeeper nicky weaver makes his long-awaited return in a reserve game at blackburn on tuesday. former england under- keeper weaver has missed nearly three full seasons with a succession of knee injuries which eventually needed pioneering transplant surgery earlier this year.
771,opposition grows to house arrests the conservatives have expressed serious misgivings about government plans for keeping uk and foreign terror suspects under house arrest. michael howard said he would not back the home secretary s plans for control orders which include home detention. i do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician he said. the lib dems also oppose the proposals but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat. the government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. new metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair has backed the control orders saying: i m sorry. it is a dilemma but there is only one choice. but mr howard said: we have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the british way of life. he argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. mr howard said he feared internment without trial creates martyrs and could be a very effective recruiting sergeant for terrorists . his party plans to move an amendment to the serious organised crime and police bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. he called on the prime minister to enter into constructive discussions with his party to find a better way forward . controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the uk without trial or charge since december was freed from jail. home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man known only as c certified as a terrorist suspect. on monday the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. most of the terror suspects are detained at belmarsh prison in london. the liberal democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio s today programme: it s a matter of principle for us that we can t have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals. the lib dems believe the home secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions. we think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging surveillance limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the home secretary s say so. that must be done with a proper judicial process a judge involved in making those decisions said mr oaten. mr clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. he said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in serious cases with independent scrutiny from judges.
1647,game makers get xbox sneak peek microsoft has given game makers a glimpse of the new xbox console. some details of the xbox s performance and what gaming will be like with the device were given at the annual game developers conference in the us. xbox frontman j. allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second. also all titles for the new xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games. microsoft is saving the official unveiling of the xbox codenamed xenon for the show in may and the device could be on shop shelves by november. however during his keynote speech at gdc mr allard who heads development of game-making tools for the console gave a glimpse into how some of its core software will work. he said gaming was entering a high-definition era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the hdtv people were starting to watch as well as the hd dvds that will soon start to appear. industry watchers took this to mean that the xbox will push for hdtv quality graphics as standard as well as multi-channel audio to give gamers an authentic experience. mr allard said microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the xbox and for players to get playing. to this end microsoft was building in to xbox hardware systems to support headset chat buddy list controls and custom soundtracks so developers were free to concentrate on the games. the xbox would also support well-known industry specifications such as directx to make it simple for game studios to make titles for the console. for gamers this emphasis on ease of use would mean every xbox title uses the same interface to set up online play and get at music stored on the hardware. this interface will hold details of a player s statistics and skill level on a gamer card as well as give access to a store where people can spend small amounts of cash to buy extras for their avatars or add-ons such as new maps or vehicles for games they possess. this ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future said mr allard. only with such consistency would the xbox be able to support the - million subscribers that it was aiming for said mr allard. during his speech mr allard took several swipes at the playstation and said processors for consoles had to be made with developers not just engineers in mind. our approach is bruce lee not brute force he said.
2018,uk plan to deport terror suspects deals are being sought to allow the uk to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death. home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached. the move follows a law lords judgement that the detention of men at belmarsh prison london and woodhill milton keynes was unlawful. the affected by the ruling are from algeria tunisia egypt and jordan. the government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after september to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws. mr clarke told the times: i think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come. he said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with foreign secretary jack straw in a very positive way . mr clarke said that he was seeking memorandums of understanding between overseas governments and britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. however he added: i do not think the solution to the law lords judgement for this government is in deportations but they will help. there are other strands that we have to do. but the liberal democrat s shadow home secretary mark oaten accused mr clarke of avoiding the main issue with the belmarsh detainees. the critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future he told bbc news. and i do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing for example intercept communications telephone tapping to be included mr oaten said. deportation may tackle this initial problem but i want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country. unless we get that the liberal democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in march. the bbc s home affairs correspondent daniel sandford said it appeared mr clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor david blunkett. but he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees home countries could be difficult. some of these people are accused of very very serious crimes in their home countries so it s not an easy agreement to get and i think for some of these suspects it won t be the solution. daniel sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks. the government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial he said.
301,fox attacks blair s tory lies tony blair lied when he took the uk to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign say the tories. tory co-chairman liam fox was speaking after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a hard right agenda . dr fox told bbc radio: if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war i guess you are going to lie about anything at all. he would not discuss reports the party repaid £ to lord ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat. the prime minister ratcheted up labour s pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party s spring conference. he insisted he did not know the poll date but it is widely expected to be may. in what was seen as a highly personal speech in gateshead on sunday mr blair said: i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of downing street. he described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric then struggling to live up to the expectations and reaching the point of raised voices and throwing crockery . he warned his supporters against complacency saying: it s a fight for the future of our country it s a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win. mr blair said that whether the public chose michael howard or mr kennedy it would result in a tory government not a labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward . dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents policies and then attacking the lies. what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and it s going to be fear and smear he told bbc news. the tory co-chairman attacked labour s six new pledges as vacuous and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid £ to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election. we repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters he said insisting he enjoyed a warm and constructive relationship to lord ashcroft. meanwhile lib dem leader charles kennedy is expected to attack mr blair s words as he begins a nationwide tour on monday. mr kennedy is accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester liverpool leicester somerset basingstoke shrewsbury dorset and torbay. he said: this is three-party politics. in the northern cities the contest is between labour and the liberal democrats. in southern and rural seats - especially in the south west - the principal contenders are the liberal democrats and the conservatives who are out of the running in scotland and wales. the lib dems accuse mr blair of making a touchy-feely speech to labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.
1810,yukos unit fetches $ at auction a little-known russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant yukos at auction in moscow. baikal finance group outbid favourite gazprom the state-controlled gas monopoly to buy yuganskneftegas. baikal paid . roubles ($.: £.) for yugansk - nowhere near the $ russia says yukos owes in taxes. yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and russian law and said baikal had bought itself trouble. the company considers that the victor of today s auction has bought itself a serious $ headache said yukos spokesman alexander shadrin. he said the company would continue to make every lawful move to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in yukos from this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property . meanwhile tim osborne head of yukos main shareholders group menatep said that yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt and that legal action would be taken outside russia against the auction winners. reports from russia say baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $. from a sberbank (savings bank) account to the russian federal property fund for yugansk. the sale came despite a restraining order issued by a us court dealing with the firm s bankruptcy application for chapter protection. yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but russian authorities argued they were imposing the law trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. there were originally four registered bidders and with its close ties to the kremlin state-backed gas monopoly gazprom had been seen as favourite. but just two companies turned up for the auction gazprom and the unknown baikal finance group named after a large freshwater lake in siberia. and according to tass news agency gazprom did not make a single bid leaving the way open for baikal which paid above the auction start price of . roubles. mystery firm baikal finance group is officially registered in the central russian region of tver but many analysts believe it may be linked to gazprom. kaha kiknavelidze analyst at troika dialog said: i think a decision that yugansk should end up with gazprom was taken a long time ago. so the main question was how to structure this transaction. i would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and gazprom now has a partner. i would also not exclude that baikal will decline to pay in days that are given by law and gazprom is then recognised as the winner. this would give gazprom an extra days to accumulate the needed funds. another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price. however gazprom has announced it is not linked to baikal in any way. and paul collison chief analyst at brunswick ubs said: i see no plausible explanation for the theory that baikal was representing competing interests. yugansk will most likely end up with gazprom but could still end up with the government. there is still potential for surprises. yugansk is at the heart of yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. the unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $ in taxes and fines. yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant and had sought refuge in us courts. the us bankruptcy court s initial order on thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to yukos filing for chapter bankruptcy protection was upheld in a second ruling on saturday. the protection if recognised by the russian authorities would have allowed yukos current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky is now in jail on separate fraud charges. but president vladimir putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the bbc s sarah rainsford in moscow says most russians believe the destruction of yukos is now inevitable. hours before the auction lawyers for menatep a group through which mr khodorkovsky and his associates control yukos said they would take legal action in other countries. menatep lawyers who were excluded from observing the auction said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound russian oil and gas exports.

119,chelsea sack mutu chelsea have sacked adrian mutu after he failed a drugs test. the -year-old tested positive for a banned substance - which he later denied was cocaine - in october. chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for mutu a £. signing from parma last season who may face a two-year suspension. a statement from chelsea explaining the decision read: we want to make clear that chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs. mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at stamford bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach jose mourinho. chelsea s statement added: this applies to both performance-enhancing drugs or so-called recreational drugs. they have no place at our club or in sport. in coming to a decision on this case chelsea believed the club s social responsibility to its fans players employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company. any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as football association rules. the club totally supports the fa in strong action on all drugs cases. fifa s disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a six-month ban. and the sport s world governing body has re-iterated their stance over mutu s failed drugs test maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities. fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the english fa have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it said a fifa spokesman. chelsea s move won backing from drug-testing expert michelle verroken. verroken a former director of drug-free sport for uk sport insists the blues were right to sack mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so. chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate. it was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make. it is a very clear stance by chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club. it emerged that mutu had failed a drugs test on october and although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine. the romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance. the football association has yet to act on mutu s failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case.
1578,golden rule boost for chancellor chancellor gordon brown has been given a £. boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule which allows him to borrow only for investment. the extra leeway came after the office for national statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years. it comes just weeks ahead of the budget and an expected general election. shadow chancellor oliver letwin said: at best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government. a review by the ons found it had made a mistake by double counting some spending on roads since /. correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment thus helping mr brown to meet his golden rule of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle. economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the budget. the changes by the ons increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £. in total. mr letwin said: this is a very murky area... there will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled. the conservatives also said mr brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual £. black hole in the nation s coffers. but the treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions. in january the independent institute for fiscal studies (ifs) said mr brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year s budget. it also said the government might narrowly miss its golden rule if the current economic cycle ended in /. after the ons announcement economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in / of about £. none of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years said jonathan loynes chief uk economist at capital economics. accordingly it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course.
592,china ripe for media explosion asia is set to drive global media growth to and beyond with china and india filling the two top spots analysts have predicted. japan south korea and singapore will also be strong players but china s demographics give it the edge a media conference in london heard. the world s most populous country - population . - now has about million middle-class consumers. forty per cent fall in the key to -year-old demographic. as a result it is attracting huge foreign investment in media and communications analysts told the financial times new media and broadcasting conference last week. interest in china among international media groups has surged in recent months after beijing issued rules allowing foreign investment in joint-venture television radio and film production companies. news corporation viacom and sony pictures are among the big names involved in joint ventures with chinese players. more than million chinese listen to radio stations while tv stations broadcast channels. china central television (cctv) the state broadcaster claims an audience of more than a billion people. of the country s million households million receive cable tv programmes. the rest could be a potential audience for satellite broadcasting which china plans to launch in . the state administration of radio film and television (sarft) which regulates broadcasting plans to move all programmes to digital by . the continuing roll-out of new digital channels has boosted demand for quality content creating significant opportunities for both chinese and foreign content providers. but according to recent reports from china the authorities have tightened controls over foreign investment in tv production joint ventures. it has limited most foreign companies to only one joint venture and banned the involvement of any found to be unfriendly according to reports. the sarft said: there is a very strong ideological component to production of broadcast television programmes. it added: china must understand the political tendencies and background of overseas partners and prevent joint ventures or cooperation from bringing harmful foreign thinking or culture into our production sector. according to the financial times china correspondent the new rules highlight the political sensitivities that surround foreign involvement in china s media sector. this is despite beijing s decision to open the state-dominated sector to international investment. as well as traditional broadcasting chinese and foreign entrepreneurs alike see fortunes waiting to be made in new media like mobile services and online gaming. mobile games already account for % of revenues from china s million mobile users. online gaming sales are predicted to top a billion us dollars next year according to the uk-based journal screen digest. the video market is also seen as a big opportunity although piracy levels are still very high despite an anti-piracy drive during the past year. in the cinema industry the deployment of digital screens is being accelerated. this is not just to modernise venues but also to curb piracy and regulate distribution. li ruigang president of the commercial broadcaster shanghai media group told the conference that china s new media market is already experiencing explosive growth . it was particularly strong in charged broadband services and mobile value-added services. leading china-watcher and founder of the cga consultancy jeanne-marie gescher agreed that the time was ripe for foreign media groups to tap china s huge media market potential. china s media are now driven by investors who do not care how people consume media - they just want people to consume more of it mrs gescher concluded.
2023,humanoid robot learns how to run car-maker honda s humanoid robot asimo has just got faster and smarter. the japanese firm is a leader in developing two-legged robots and the new improved asimo (advanced step in innovative mobility) can now run find his way around obstacles as well as interact with people. eventually asimo could find gainful employment in homes and offices. the aim is to develop a robot that can help people in their daily lives said a honda spokesman. to get the robot running for the first time was not an easy process as it involved asimo making an accurate leap and absorbing the impact of landing without slipping or spinning. the run he is now capable of is perhaps not quite up to olympic star kelly holmes standard. at /h it is closer to a leisurely jog. its makers claim that it is almost four times as fast as sony s qrio which became the first robot to run last year. the criteria for running robots is defined by engineers as having both feet off the ground between strides. asimo has improved in other ways too increasing his walking speed from ./h to . growing to and putting on in weight. while he may not quite be ready for yoga he does have more freedom of movement being able to twist his hips and bend his wrists thumbs and neck. asimo has already made his mark on the international robot scene and in november was inducted into the robot hall of fame. he has wowed audiences around the world with his ability to walk upstairs recognise faces and come when beckoned. in august he even attended a state dinner in the czech republic travelling with the japanese prime minister as a goodwill envoy. he is one of a handful of robots used by tech firms to trumpet their technological advances. technology developed for asimo could be used in the automobile industry as electronics increasingly take over from mechanics in car design. for the moment asimo s biggest role is an entertainer and the audience gathered to see his first public run greeted his slightly comical gait with amusement according to reports. robots can fulfil serious functions in society and the united nations economic commission for europe predicts that the worldwide market for industrial robots will swell from units in to in .
2080,howard unveils tory asylum plans tory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees michael howard has said. as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. there would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. some charities say the plans would put refugees lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled. tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans. by cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders they will actually make the problem worse said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was absolutely disgusting to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. in a speech in london on monday mr howard said: it s not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it. he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that firm but fair immigration controls were essential for good community relations. - withdrawing from the united nations convention on refugees which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need not numbers - introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents - detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk - a worry for national security - stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps. anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin. the tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the uk. mr howard said nearly people were settling in the uk every year - the size of a city like peterborough. the plans would help achieve a substantial reduction in immigration he said although he could not predict a figure. he said that only two out of asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current unfair and inhumane system. we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum mr howard said. by breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling. but the un refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. refugee council chief executive maeve sherlock called the plans dangerous ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible . lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled she warned. commission for racial equality chairman trevor phillips said asylum applications were down % and economic migration down about %. he did not think mr howard intended to centre the debate about race. but he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. mr howard called that suggestion disgraceful .
447,weak data buffets french economy a batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over the french economy s future prospects. official figures showed on friday that unemployment was unchanged at .% last month while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in october. at the same time finance minister nicolas sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to french growth. [oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term and potentially on confidence he said. world oil prices have risen by more than % since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand. analysts said french companies keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs were reluctant to take on extra staff. [the unemployment figures] show the main problem of the french economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment said marc touati an economist at natexis banques populaires. politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms otherwise in five or ten years it will be too late. obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in france than in many other european economies. many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. the french statistics agency insee expects the economy to grow by about .% this year buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment. that is above the projected eurozone average of just above %.
426,bortolami predicts dour contest italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday s six nations contest against scotland will be a scrappy encounter. with both sides looking for their first win of the championship the third-round game at murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider. and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs. it will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win said the lock forward. italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in but two of those have come against scotland. this year italy opened up with a stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing -. however they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out. now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations. scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh said bortolami. we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs. as a nation our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games.

1700,california sets fines for spyware the makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home pcs could face hefty fines in california. from january a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. the legislation which was approved by governor arnold schwarzenegger is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing pc users in the coming year. the software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. at its worst it has the ability to hijack personal data like passwords login details and credit card numbers. the programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate. one form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user s web-surfing. it can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. in washington congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills but california is a step ahead. the state s consumer protection against spyware act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. it also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. consumers are able to seek up to $ in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. the new law marks a continuing trend in california towards tougher privacy rights. a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that % of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that on average each one is harbouring separate spyware programs. currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and ad-aware.

1608,final hunts held as ban looms hunts in england and wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal with more due out later. thousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than meets many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a thursday. the ban on hunting with dogs comes into effect from gmt on friday. the countryside alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on wednesday when the appeal court ruled the hunting act was lawful. but the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits. others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally. anti-hunt organisations for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning say they hope most will stay within the law. mike hobday of the league against cruel sports told bbc news: we ve long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do. but if they continue to chase foxes to chase wild mammals around the countryside that s against the law and we re confident they ll be brought to justice. at the headquarters of quorn hunt in leicestershire feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt. bbc correspondent sarah mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears. she said many people did not share the countryside alliance s optimism that hunting would be able to continue. farmer geoff brooks a senior member of the quorn hunt told bbc news people s lives revolved around hunting . he described the ban as ridiculous and badly thought out but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record. at the court of appeal on wednesday the countryside alliance failed in its attempt to have the hunting act ruled invalid. but it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police. the alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on saturday. the league against cruel sports and the rspca say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions. the association of chief police officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules. a spokesman said: basically it s not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields it will be based on intelligence and information received as well. the decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected. he said police would consider evidence submitted by anti-hunt organisations on its merits.

1376,ec calls truce in deficit battle the european commission (ec) has called a truce in its battle with france and germany over breaching deficit limits. the move came after france and germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the eu cap in - for the first time in four years. but the ec did warn the two were under close scrutiny and it would act if their fiscal situations deteriorated. under eu rules member countries must keep their deficits below %. france and germany will breach that this year. it will be the third year in a row that the two countries have broken the european union s stability and growth pact rules. the eurozone s two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in november when they persuaded fellow eu members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold. the commission then took the pair to the european court of human justice - which ruled eu countries could not put the pact in abeyance and confirmed the ec s right to launch excessive debt procedures . after announcing its decision to erase france and germany from its list of deficit rule breakers the eu said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget s below %. the commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by it said in a statement. the eu expects the german deficit to fall to fall to .% of gdp next year from .% this year while france s is forecast to drop to % from an expected .% this year. the forecasts are based on ec predictions of gdp growth of .% in germany next year and .% in france. berlin welcomed the decision with finance minister hans eichel saying it showed that the ec recognised germany s fiscal policy was on the right track even amid very difficult economic conditions . however paris was more subdued with finance minister herve gaymard telling parliament: we must continue along this path of saving money. however the move still had its critics with the european people s party (epp) attacking the ec for backing down from punitive action. the commission is buckling under the pressure from germany and france epp spokesman alexander radwan said. the scary fact is that budget sinners despite having repeatedly exceeded the % deficit limit do not have to fear any sanctions. despite the commission delivering its decision on the two biggest eurozone economies it refused to comment on similar action against greece which has also broken the % deficit ceiling. monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said that it was a matter for next week.
880,roundabout continues nostalgia trip the new big-screen version of the magic roundabout released in the uk on friday is the latest attempt to turn children s television into box-office gold. recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit s five children and it previously filmed by the bbc in . he-man and transformers which were cartoon favourites in the will soon receive their own costly makeovers. with screen versions of the a-team the dukes of hazzard and even blake s seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big business. but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals. the new version of the magic roundabout which will be released as sprung! in the us replaces the stop-motion models of the tv show with polished computer-generated animation. in a similar fashion the thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original s puppets and models. the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences. pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout while the now-defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song. but while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been a significant backlash. this cg-animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the stop-motion roundabout a cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site. and the recent puppet comedy team america: world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry anderson s thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins. dan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic children s tv shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention. i can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today. but i think it s backfiring. what s next - the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $ (£) but only recouped $ (£) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating. it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment. after the success of garfield: the movie britain s shabby tabby surely deserves his own film vehicle. with only episodes made of the series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ. furry recyclers have already had one big-screen outing - s wombling free. but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback. advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbc s supernatural comedy . and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tv s most popular cartoon buccaneer . it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed. the magic roundabout is out in the uk on february. how about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his money! thundercats!! i loved it. should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in! it will bring my youth back! get your hands off the clangers! is nothing sacred make a movie version of the banana splits! what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy. you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse! but then again it couldn t be better than the original series could it it s always nice to see these old toons re-released but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song!) i think i ve been completely put off. just leave these classics alone as good memories. i think remakes are a good idea. as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe. i believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular. as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series. personally i d like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and m.a.s.k. get full hollywood remakes. leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson. love to see transformers with real actors and cgi. and make it at least a rating. part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect. they were moody sarcastic and rather human. just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved. dougal never smiled like that! films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place. i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film. it s got all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story. bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two. it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it. it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation. it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are film-makers running out of original ideas all i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever. i recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a child. there was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back. again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original s cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate. we live in a sampling world - the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new. seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something new. it got to be mr.benn. the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing! if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great. and who to play the lead role well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin. if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character. muffin the mule perhaps after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know! why can t the british film industry try making gerry anderson s ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow people. in today s media it seems the past is the future. tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes dj s are sampling or re-working s and s music. even computer games from - years ago are getting modern re-workings. personally i think it shows that no one has any originality any more! why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone. mary mungo and midge. but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs. plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block yeah but no but i wasn t even there! i d like to see mr. benn with brad pitt in the title role. sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner. it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia. there are plany of modern children s book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the past mr. benn with rowan atkinson as the lead. would have loved to see dungeons & dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn t come up to scratch. the only one that isn t to be remade as yet is thundercats which i d like to see. i m an expat living in norway and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite children s programs for my daughters. my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen!! very scandinavian... rainbow! i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because it s original witty and modern. the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago. how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!! if a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then i ll be the first one on amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch. repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price! i don t care! till then i ll have to make do with the citreon advert. i d luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same. and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb children s programme. could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torch....hmmmmm i could go on and on. danger mouse at i m showing my age. :-) noggin the nog was one of the best children s programs. the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach oliver postgate s wonderful voices. so in general leave well alone. the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story. just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like fingermouse bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks. in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo. will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall. one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe . it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe s car. of course gerry anderson s supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen big-budget action. it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a children t movie that really let it down. after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves. it s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods isn t it i d hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation - i love that done in a shed clunkiness and you couldn t recreate the magic. perhaps if the remakes were done in a look around you mock-authentic style i might be interested ... chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch; that would be mega! this re-gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people s ideas because it guarantees to bring in the $$$. the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc. the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short-term. the fact that they will be forgotten in months time is irrelevant (e.g. starsky & hutch) hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it! i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies. i m only and don t remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and it s a classic. the fact it s so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today s stuff it looks amateurish. thats the appeal though it s so innocent (like chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.
1571,bath faced with tindall ultimatum mike tindall s agent has warned bath they have until next week to improve their contract offer to the england man or risk losing him to a rival club. dipo alli says he has received an offer for tindall which dwarfs bath s deal and that two other clubs want to talk. mike does not want to go into the six nations worrying about where he will be playing his club rugby next season alli told the guardian newspaper. it is up to (bath owner) andrew brownsword. he has to make it happen. tindall is out of contract at the end of the season but it is understood that brownsword is unwilling to break the club s salary structure to accommodate the -year-old s demands. but alli insists the player is worth more than bath have put on the table. mike has been at bath for eight years and wants to remain with the club and his demands are anything but excessive the agent added. but brownsword has to recognise mike s value and we want to resolve things by the end of next week.
1797,standoff on deutsche s lse bid deutsche boerse investors unhappy with its london stock exchange bid will have no chance to throw out the exchange s management until may reuters says. the sunday times reported that hedge funds tci and atticus were planning to demand the removal of the group s chairman and chief executive. but deutsche boerse told news agency reuters such a move would have to wait until may s annual general meeting. investors want deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid. we are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management. we are not scared to take this to its conclusion this time atticus david slager told the sunday times. however deutsche boerse told reuters: tci s request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on may . the sunday times reported that tci had been drawing up a list of heavyweight executives to replace deutsche s chairman rolf breuer and chief executive werner seifert. the group owns more than % of deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the german exchange s management. under german law deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid. tci and atticus have opposed the lse bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value and would be better spent on a share buyback. deutsche is in competition with pan-european bourse euronext to take over the london exchange. many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out. however any such move would have to wait until march when the office of fair trading completes an investigation into the competition aspects of the pair s takeover proposals.
713,music man to the oscars bill conti s job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the faint-hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate-spinning assignment. this year marks conti s turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra. the excitement is a live performance as a musician he says. all of your colleagues everyone in the film industry is in the theatre. all the important people. i guess it s just a television show but we always think it s a bit more. the orchestra strikes up more than times during the average oscars show. as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house. it s a very busy evening it takes a certain amount of preparation of music orchestrating sketching rehearsing before the show. but you don t know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director it s exciting explains conti. and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed. we don t know who the winners will be. so when they say the winner is we have five different pieces of music in front of us they say the name we play the appropriate one immediately adds conti. the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches despite being told to be brief by the show s producers. the decision to drown out or kill the offending star with music is relayed from the director s box to the orchestra via conti s earpiece. i don t feel good about it at all. it s not my call though he says. when the director says music the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall. we don t usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off. the person that s been cut off who s feet from me is glaring at me like it s death time. on occasions some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak. julia roberts when she came on she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do he says. conti received an oscar in for the original score of the right stuff. he also received two nominations in the original song category in for gonna fly now from rocky and in for the title song from for your eyes only. it s a moment in the sun he says. when people get up there some people this is hard to believe people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining might get a little flustered. but there s this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they re either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met. the image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories. behind the scenes the key players such as conti have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with. there s a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls. i can control hearing in my ears the left ear or the right ear - different things at different times. i have to communicate with the director. i have a little microphone that s attached to my headset. to open up that microphone i have a footswitch he explains. conti s most nerve-wracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director in when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke. conti immediately told the show s director: i start cursing and screaming i tell him we re not going to die for this show - you must do something or i m going to climb out of this pit with musicians and we re going to be home in minutes. oh no bill don t do anything came the response. imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra or so of them in the pit and while we re playing firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke. the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands. no one died it s not a big story but it was scary at the time laughs conti. when the ceremony is over the music director attends the annual governor s ball with his family. i have a drink and relive the show he says. i m not for too much carousing. i go home and unwind. it takes me about a day.
1136,imf cuts german growth estimate the international monetary fund is to cut its growth forecast for the german economy from .% to .% the financial times deutschland reported. the imf will also reduce its growth estimate for the -member eurozone economy from .% to .% the newspaper reported. the german economy has been faltering with unemployment levels rising to a seventy-year high of . million. its sluggish performance continues to hamper the entire eurozone. the imf s draft world economic outlook - due to be published in april - would point to a marked deterioration in germany s economy the ft report said. in september the imf had said that german growth for the current year would be .%. the imf has also revised eurozone forecasts the paper said taking into account high oil prices the strength of the euro and weak demand in many of the world s leading economies. europe s economic difficulties have been highlighted by the organisation for economic co-operation and development which argued in a report published on tuesday that the continent could only achieve us living standards by freeing up its labour markets. the eurozone does not look like it has a self-sustaining recovery james carrick an economist with abn amro told the newspaper. it is too dependant on the rest of the world.
1471,glazer makes new man utd approach malcolm glazer has made a fresh approach to buy manchester united which could lead to a bid valuing the premiership club at £. the us tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last months has approached the united board with detailed proposals it has confirmed. mr glazer who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. his new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt. mr glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the red devils and responded by using his .% shareholding to vote off three board members last november. man united had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. but newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid. last week however mr glazer issued a statement to the stock exchange distancing himself from a new bid. meanwhile united s chief executive david gill said in december that talks would not resume unless glazer came up with definitive proposals . now the board has confirmed that the us bidder is back with a statement issued on sunday reading: the board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer. a further announcement will be made in due course. to succeed malcolm glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus who own .% of the club. but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach. united fans have reacted with anger at the announcement. they have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by glazer since he first showed interest in the club in september and after sunday s announcement they vowed to fight on. we will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says. we do not want him or anybody else taking over united said mark longden of the independent manchester united supporters association. the campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since glazer first showed interest in the club.
281,thanou bullish over drugs hearing katerina thanou is confident she and fellow sprinter kostas kenteris will not be punished for missing drugs tests before the athens olympics. the greek pair appeared at a hearing on saturday which will determine whether their provisional bans from athletics ruling body the iaaf should stand. after five months we finally had the chance to give explanations. i am confident and optimistic said thanou. we presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of. the athletes lawyer grigoris ioanidis said he believed the independent disciplinary committee set up by the greek athletics federation (segas) would find them innocent. we are almost certain that the charges will be dropped said ioanidis. we believe that we have presented [a case] that the charges are unreasonable. thanou the olympic women s silver medallist and sydney champion kenteris were suspended by the iaaf for missing three drugs tests. the third was supposed to take place on the eve of the athens games last august but the pair could not be found in the athletes village. they were later taken to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. thanou s coach christos tzekos was also suspended by the iaaf. we were asked [by the disciplinary committee] all kinds of questions about the night of august said tzekos. we did not leave any gaps. as far as i am concerned there is no such issue [of refusing to be tested] and i am very optimistic. tzekos thanou and kenteris who have all denied the charges can expect a decision within a month. deliberations will start after some additional documents are brought in by thursday said committee chairman kostas panagopoulos. i estimate that the final ruling will be issued by the end of february.
65,broadband in the uk growing fast high-speed net connections in the uk are proving more popular than ever. bt reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. the connections take the total number of people in the uk signing up for broadband from bt to almost . million. nationally more than million browse the net via broadband. britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of europe. according to figures gathered by industry watchdog ofcom the growth means that the uk has now surpassed germany in terms of broadband users per people. the uk total of . million translates into . connections per people compared to . in germany and . in the netherlands. the numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name. part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk s most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond . asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. the standard speed is though faster connections are available. this breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas said paul reynolds chief executive of bt wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. bt retail which sells net services under its own name also had a good quarter and provided about % of the new broadband customers. this was a slight increase on the previous three months. despite the good news about growth in broadband figures from telecommunications regulator ofcom show that bt faces increasing competition and dwindling influence in other sectors. local loop unbundling (llu) in which bt rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer s home or office is growing steadily. cable & wireless and ntl have announced that they are investing millions to start offering llu services. by the end of september more than . million phone lines were using so-called carrier pre-section (cps) services such as talktalk and one.tel which route phone calls across non-bt networks from a local exchange. there are now more than different firms offering cps services and the percentage of people using bt lines for voice calls has shrunk to .%.
720,hansen delays return until british triple jumper ashia hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury according to reports. hansen the commonwealth and european champion has been sidelined since the european cup in poland in june . it was hoped she would be able to return this summer but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal. her coach aston moore told the times: we re not looking at any sooner than not as a triple jumper. moore said hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner but there is no short-term prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event. there was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months but that has been solved and we can push ahead now he said. the aim is for her to get fit as an athlete - then we will start looking at sprinting and the long jump as an introduction back to the competitive arena. moore said he is confident hansen can make it back to top-level competition though it is unclear if that will be in time for the commonwealth games in melbourne next march when she will be . it s been a frustrating time for her but it has not fazed her determination he added.
2065,microsoft launches its own search microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home-grown search engine. the now formally launched msn search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in november . the revamped engine indexes more pages than before can give direct answers to factual questions and features tools to help people create detailed queries. microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries. google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query keep up with news or search for images. but in the last year google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals such as yahoo and microsoft and new entrants such as amazon and blinkx try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves. this renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information - be it for a particular web page recipe book gadget news story image or anything else. microsoft is keen to make its home-grown search engine a significant rival to google. to generate its corpus of data microsoft has indexed billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days - more often than rivals. the microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer. for its direct answer feature microsoft is calling on its encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions facts calculations conversions and solutions to equations. tony macklin director of product at ask jeeves pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since april . the major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search so in many ways microsoft is following the market he said. tools sitting alongside the msn search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites countries regions or languages. microsoft is also using so-called graphic equalisers that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more up-to-date or more popular. the company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system. the test or beta version of the msn search engine unveiled in november had a few teething troubles. on its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed.
494,arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at white hart lane. there had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen s role at the club. it is absolutely not true arnesen told bbc radio five live. there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems. he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself. arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just games in charge. he added: jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. but i trust him in that; you have to accept it. i think we should respect it. the plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on monday we will clarify the situation. arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement coming less than hours before tottenham s premiership fixture with charlton. when it comes down to personal problems i don t think we should talk about timing he said. and he also denied reports that santini had been given a £ pay-off. that is absolute nonsense. he is the one who said i will go and so he went said the spurs sporting director. tottenham s structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and arnesen sees no reason why they should change it. i have confidence in this structure. i am confident that we have started something here in july and i still have a lot of confidence in tottenham and what we are doing he said. however former spurs and england defender gary stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift. i think the problems go a lot deeper between the director of football at white hart lane and santini stevens told five live. on paper they could have worked together. but frank arnesen was a very creative forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas i think santini was very much the opposite more a case of being organised disciplined and happy not conceding goals. that sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely. but it seems that has not happened.
673,msps hear renewed climate warning climate change could be completely out of control within several decades the scottish environment protection agency is warning a committee of msps. experts are giving evidence on the subject to the scottish parliament s environment committee. officials believe nuclear energy and wind farms may be better options than trying to tackle global warming. solutions suggested by conservationists include reducing internal uk air travel and boosting electric trains. the evidence is part of the committee s inquiry into the impact of climate change in scotland. sepa is attempting to curb global warming gases as pollution from transport emissions increases. ecologists are warning msps that scotland may have to accept significant intrusion from wind farms. it is likely also that nuclear power will be needed for possibly several decades. sepa predict that the two methods will remain as energy sources until climate change is under control. experts studying the seas off scotland s west coast have already forecast more devastating weather of the type which caused havoc across the country last month. they predicted that damaging storms will become more frequent. researchers from the university of the highlands and islands and southampton have been looking at wave heights in the atlantic over the last nine years. the project was conducted jointly by the environmental research institute in thurso which is part of the university of the highlands and islands (uhi) millennium institute network and the southampton oceanography centre. scientists carried out a series of studies including the use of satellites to assess wave heights in the seas around the west coast and the hebrides.
891,councils must find gypsy sites ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments. councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land. more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks said housing minister yvette cooper. in november mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because travellers have no place to stop. ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places. that scheme has paid out £ in four years with £ available for . there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites said ms cooper. firstly local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites. and secondly they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites. the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers. that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment. under the new regulations expected to be in force in the spring officials will be able to serve temporary stop notices aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban. many mps with rural constituencies particularly in eastern england have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments. andrew ryder of the traveller law reform coalition said: we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored. new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers as they often do. living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals legal action and eviction is no one s idea of fun. in their november report mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister responsible for housing said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop. numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities said the mps. in turn the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents. two of the most controversial traveller sites - cottenham in cambridgeshire and minety in wiltshire - remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle.

1243,bridge could miss rest of season chelsea left-back wayne bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle. the england international was hurt in an innocuous challenge with alan shearer during the londoners fa cup defeat at newcastle on sunday. we think it s a big injury said jose mourinho whose chelsea team this week meet barcelona in the champions league and liverpool in the carling cup final. william gallas and damien duff could also miss the barcelona game. france defender gallas and ireland winger duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of chelsea s - defeat at st james park. with bridge having gone off after mourinho used all three substitutes those knocks plus carlo cudicini s red card meant chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. cudicini would not have played against barcelona but had been promised a game in the carling cup final although he will now miss the cardiff showpiece through suspension. the manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to barcelona even though he has few options to replace bridge at left-back. celestine babayaro left the club in january ironically to join newcastle and although gallas has deputised at left-back before he is struggling to be fit himself. it could be that paulo ferreira usually a right-back is switched to left-back with glen johnson who ended the newcastle game in goal playing on the right. youngsters ben hudell joe keenan and sam tillen would be options should mourinho decide to call up a replacement but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a champions league tie. bridge s injury also means mourinho who reportedly wants to sign ashley cole from arsenal will not have a specialist senior left-back for the run-in to the season. he (bridge) has no chance of playing against barcelona probably will not play against liverpool (in the carling cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season he said. the medical department will try to do everything to recover gallas and duff. we will have to wait and see but i won t cry about injuries because we will have players to play on tuesday. shearer said he was unsure what caused bridge s injury. i don t know what happened. he said. it was just a shame. i don t think we even touched each other. by all accounts it s pretty serious. i went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best. mourinho whose team are chasing three trophies has already lost winger arjen robben to a serious injury.

1316,hearts - livingston hearts wrapped up their scottish cup quarter-final tie against livingston with two goals in the first minutes. lee miller scored inside the opening seconds heading over colin meldrum and into the net from a jamie mcallister free kick. mcallister himself scored the second when he met saul mikoliunas cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. craig easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but hearts held on. the opening goal came after gus bahoken had clumsily fouled miller yards from goal. mcallister floated the free kick into the livi box and miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from yards over meldrum. with just minutes on the clock the home side doubled their lead. mikoliunas sprinted down the right crossed to the back post where mcallister raced in to head past meldrum. moments later miller came close to grabbing his second with a first-time drive from yards which skimmed the bar. then mcallister picked up a pass from stephen simmons and drove an angled shot from yards narrowly past meldrum s far post. the impressive mikoliunas twice went close before half time - a low drive was comfortably gathered by meldrum and then he curled a left-footed shot past the keeper s right-hand post. livi manager richard gough made three changes at the interval bringing on defender goran stanic midfielder gabor vincze and striker ferenc horvath for bahoken derek lilley and mark wilson. but in the opening stages of the second period little changed. however the west lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal. eric deloumeaux sent jason dair away on the right and he tried to give the ball to mcpake who looked to be in an offside position. the livi striker ignored the pass however and dair ran on to it and played easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range. the home side called for offside against mcpake but referee alan freeland ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle. livi went all out for the equaliser. in the minute burton o brien was hauled back at the edge of the box by neil macfarlane but dair sent his shot just inches wide. gordon webster miller hartley neilson mcallister simmons (macfarlane ) berra burchill (wyness ) mikoliunas (cesnauskis ) wallace. moilanen kizys. berra webster. miller mcallister . meldrum mcnamee bahoken (stanic ) deloumeaux strong dair easton mark wilson (vincze ) lilley (horvath ) o brien mcpake. mckenzie hand. : vincze horvath. easton . a freeland
10,berlin cheers for anti-nazi film a german movie about an anti-nazi resistance heroine has drawn loud applause at berlin film festival. sophie scholl - the final days portrays the final days of the member of the white rose movement. scholl was arrested and beheaded with her brother hans in for distributing leaflets condemning the abhorrent tyranny of adolf hitler. director marc rothemund said: i have a feeling of responsibility to keep the legacy of the scholls going. we must somehow keep their ideas alive he added. the film drew on transcripts of gestapo interrogations and scholl s trial preserved in the archive of communist east germany s secret police. their discovery was the inspiration behind the film for rothemund who worked closely with surviving relatives including one of scholl s sisters to ensure historical accuracy on the film. scholl and other members of the white rose resistance group first started distributing anti-nazi leaflets in the summer of . they were arrested as they dropped leaflets at munich university calling for a day of reckoning with adolf hitler s regime. the film focuses on the six days from scholl s arrest to the intense trial which saw scholl initially deny the charges and ended with a defiant appearance. it is one of three german films vying for a top prize at the festival. a south african film version of bizet s tragic opera carmen shot in cape town in the xhosa language has also premiered at the berlin festival. the film is entitled u-carmen ekhayelitsha or carmen in khayelitsha after the township in which the story is set. it is performed by a -strong music and theatre troupe in their debut film performance. the film is the first south african feature in years and only the second to be nominated for a golden bear award.
1988,wilkinson to miss ireland match england will have to take on ireland in the six nations without captain and goal-kicker jonny wilkinson according to his newcastle boss rob andrew. wilkinson - who had targeted the february match for his international comeback - has been missed by england not least for his goal-kicking. jonny s not fit yet falcons chief andrew told bbc radio five live. he won t be fit for dublin there s no doubt about that but he might be fit for scotland and italy. the -year-old has not played for england since the world cup final after a succession of injuries. england who have lost three six nations games in a row wasted a - half-time lead in their - defeat to france. goal-kickers charlie hodgson and olly barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop-goal between them. they ve probably got two of the best english kickers in the premiership in hodgson and barkley added andrew a former england fly-half and goal-kicker. they re both pretty good kickers. charlie is a good kicker week-in week-out. but it s all about pressure and unfortunately england are just not handling the pressure at the moment. andrew also blamed england s poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries. they just didn t have that leadership that would have seen them through. martin johnson lawrence dallaglio and jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations he said. i think it is really difficult for jason robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back. meanwhile former england full-back dusty hare put england s mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness. jonny wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an % kicking success rate hare told bbc radio five live. but natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do. you have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts. hodgson who has an excellent kicking record with club side sale sharks has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late. the top golfers don t hit the fairway every time and it is the same with goal-kicking hare added. you need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over but great goal-kickers like jonny wilkinson come along very rarely.
271,apple unveils low-cost mac mini apple has unveiled a new low-cost macintosh computer for the masses billed as the mac mini. chief executive steve jobs showed off the new machine at his annual macworld speech in san francisco. the $ macintosh sold for £ in the uk was described by jobs as the most important mac made by apple. mr jobs also unveiled the ipod shuffle a new music player using cheaper flash memory rather than hard drives which are used in more expensive ipods. the new computer shifts the company into new territory - traditionally the firm is known as a design and innovation-led firm rather than as a mass-market manufacturer. the mac mini comes without a monitor keyboard and mouse and a second version with a larger hard drive will also be sold for $. the machine - which will be available from january - was described by jobs as byodkm... bring your own display keyboard and mouse . in an attempt to win over windows pc customers mr jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems. people who are thinking of switching will have no more excuses he said. it s the newest and most affordable mac ever. the new computer has been the subject of speculation for several weeks and while few people will be surprised by the announcement many analysts had already said it was a sensible move. in january apple sued a website after it published what it said were specifications for the new computer. ian harris deputy editor of uk magazine mac format said the machine would appeal to pc-owning consumers who had purchased an ipod. they want a further taste of mac because they like what they have seen with ipod. harris added: everybody thought that apple was happy to remain a niche maker of luxury computers and moving into a market dominated by low margin manufacturers like dell is a bold move. but it shows that apple is keen to capitalise on the mass market success it s had with the ipod. the mac mini will appeal to pc users looking for an attractive no fuss computer. the new ipod shuffle comes in two versions - one offering of storage for $ (£ in the uk) and a second with one gigabyte of storage for $ (£) - and went on sale tuesday. the music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled. the smaller ipod will hold about songs said mr jobs. mr jobs told the delegates at macworld that ipod already had a % market share of all digital music players.

1317,labour s four little words labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which for those just returned from the planet galifray is looming . the slogan britain forward not back (no it s not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary time lords) is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky - it s always there but we mostly stop noticing. the word britain is cast on a red background - a nod to old labour. forward is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and along with not back is set against a mushy pea green background. as one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared it was all very post modern or something. great use of colour. those ad men really do earn their money. and coincidentally the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called fagin posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but as election supremo alan milburn declared are doing a very good job . mr milburn in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony blair are the future while michael howard and the tories would take the country backwards. not many people talk about the years before as the good old days he declared. it would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between labour and the tories. nobody he claimed could picture liberal democrat leader charles kennedy walking up downing street the day after polling. they could however picture michael howard or of course tony blair doing it. so it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition s policies and past record. and tony blair would be in the very front line of that campaign he said. between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of london than in it but in britain not overseas he promised. he will be leading the domestic debate from the front listening taking the flak. so let s get on with it then.
1194,giant waves damage s asia economy governments aid agencies insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern asia. the worst-hit areas are sri lanka india indonesia and thailand with at least people killed. early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed at about $ (£.) similar to the cash offered central america after hurricane mitch. mitch killed about people and caused damage of about $ in . world bank spokesman damien milverton told the wall street journal that he expected an aid package of financing and debt relief. tourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries providing jobs for million people in the south east asian region according to the world travel and tourism council (wttc). in the maldives islands in the indian ocean two-thirds of all jobs depend on tourism. but the damage covers fishing farming and businesses too with hundreds of thousands of buildings and small boats destroyed by the waves. international agencies have pledged their support; most say it is impossible to gauge the extent of the damage yet. the international monetary fund (imf) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope. the imf stands ready to do its part to assist these nations with appropriate support in their time of need said managing director rodrigo rato. only sri lanka and bangladesh currently receive imf support while indonesia the quake s epicentre has recently graduated from imf assistance. it is up to governments to decide if they want imf help. other agencies such as the asian development bank have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed. there is no underestimating the size of the problem however. the united nations emergency relief coordinator jan egeland said that this may be the worst national disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas... so many vulnerable communities. many people will have [had] their livelihoods their whole future destroyed in a few seconds. he warned that the longer term effects many be as devastating as the tidal wave or the tsunami itself because of the risks of epidemics from polluted drinking water. insurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the $ cost of the hurricanes that battered the us earlier this year. the region that s affected is very big so we have to check country-by-country what the situation is said serge troeber deputy head of the natural disasters department at swiss re the world s second biggest reinsurance firm. i should assume however that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the us he said. munich re the world s biggest reinsurer said: this is primarily a human tragedy. it is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be. allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability. however a low insurance bill may simply reflect the general poverty of much of the region rather than the level of economic devastation for those who live there. the international federation of the red cross and red crescent societies told the reuters news agency that it was seeking $. for emergency aid. the biggest health challenges we face is the spread of waterborne diseases particularly malaria and diarrhoea the aid agency was quoted as saying. the european union has said it will deliver euros (£.; $.) of aid according to the wall street journal. the eu s humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster . other countries also are reported to have pledged cash while the us state department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region. getting companies and business up and running also may play a vital role in helping communities recover from the weekend s events. many of the worst-hit areas such as sri lanka thailand s phuket island and the maldives are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies. december and january are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post / slump. growth has been rapid in southeast asia with the world tourism organisation figures showing a % increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first months of . in southern asia that expansion is %. india continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country the wto said. arrivals to other destinations such as... maldives and sri lanka also thrived. in thailand tourism accounts for about % of the country s annual gross domestic product or about $. in singapore the figure is close to %. tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency. in the short-term however travel companies are cancelling flights and trips. that has hit shares across asia and europe with investors saying that earnings and economic growth are likely to slow.
2180,campbell lifts lid on united feud arsenal s sol campbell has called the rivalry between manchester united and the gunners bitter and personal . past encounters have stirred up plenty of ill-feeling between the sides and they meet again at highbury on tuesday. it is just more bitter and personal against united the defender told the guardian newspaper. there s an edge. after all that has happened if we beat them it will be one of our sweetest ever wins especially because of how we lost to them up there. last october arsenal lost - at old trafford which ended a record -match unbeaten league run and sparked a mini-crisis with the gunners winning only three of their next games. it had a psychological impact on us but again because of the way we were defeated added the -year-old referring to a controversial penalty award for united s first goal. that was far more upsetting losing like that because they just seem to get away with it. you try and balance out over the course of a season but i ve had so many rough decisions against them you begin to wonder. with tensions spilling over afterwards - united boss sir alex ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players tunnel - there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on. everyone at arsenal has been waiting for this game said campbell. we are up for this one. speaking on his long-term plans campbell signalled his intent to move abroad before he turns . i m now and in five years time i won t be in this country - that s definite. italy looks good to me because it would suit my kind of football. spain is an option but the idea of tasting a new culture and learning another language excites me the most. i m starting a little with french of course.
1716,regiments group in poll move a regiments campaign group is to target nine marginal labour seats at the general election. save the scottish regiments will also field a candidate against armed forces minister adam ingram in east kilbride. the group which is unhappy at defence merger plans is endorsing opposition candidates in nine seats. the marginals are aberdeen south dumfriesshire dundee east and west south west edinburgh ochil stirling east renfrewshire and western isles. the campaigners unveiled a huge poster featuring black watch soldiers fighting the war in iraq before they announced their election plans. former scots guardsman allan hendry will challenge mr ingram. the group said it is well organised with volunteers and will be announcing at least one other candidate later. it added that it can only be stopped from inflicting serious damage on labour if the government reverses its plan to merge the six scottish regiments. scotland s only conservative mp peter duncan said the save the scottish regiments had done a superb job in fighting against defence cuts. he added: their actions have reflected the pride that most people in this country have in our troops and have shown a steely determination to make labour pay for their betrayal. i have been honoured to speak at their rallies throughout scotland. scottish national party leader alex salmond said it had received a big boost from the campaign s decision to endorse snp candidates in four marginal seats. labour s arrogance has been their undoing. in trying to get rid of scotland s historic regiments labour mps will end up being scrapped themselves he said. however labour mp george foulkes said the campaigners would not make any difference to the outcome of the election and would not win the argument. a serving soldier knows that what labour is proposing is right he said. as well as their election move save the scottish regiments will join other campaigners at a rally in london in the spring. defence secretary geoff hoon announced last year that scotland s regiments would be combined into a single unit. the move was part of overall army reforms.
1855,nuclear strike key terror risk the uk and us must realise they cannot prevent all terror attacks and should focus on making sure they are not nuclear strikes says a top academic. amitai etzioni a key influence on new labour thinking says the us emphasis on an axis of evil is misplaced. the priority should instead be on failing states including russia and pakistan who cannot properly control their nuclear material he argues. his report demands a major overhaul of world rules on nuclear technology. professor etzioni was a senior adviser to president carter s white house and is the guru behind communitarian ideas which influenced the development of blairite third way politics. in a report for the foreign policy centre think tank he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations. attempts to defend against it by hardening domestic targets cannot work nor can one rely on pre-emption by taking the war to the terrorists before they attack he says. that means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them. we must recognise that we will be unable to stop all attacks and thus ensure terrorists will not be able to strike with weapons of mass destruction prof etzioni continues. he suggests so-called rogue states such as iran and north korea are less of a problem than failed and failing states which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials. he names russia as the failing state of gravest concern as it has an estimated % of all fissile material outside america. and he is also worried about pakistan after one of its top nuclear scientists abdul qadeer khan admitted leaking nuclear secrets. prof etzioni criticises the us for overlooking those reports suggesting it was done in return for pakistani help in hunting osama bin laden. this is like letting a serial killer go because he promised to catch some jay-walkers he says. - upgrading security at nuclear arms stores as a temporary measure - creating a new global safety authority to tackle nuclear terrorism using the intelligence links established in the wake of september - backed by the united nations authority - encouraging pressuring and using all available means to persuade countries to switch their highly-enriched uranium for less dangerous less-enriched uranium - when possible taking fissile material away from failing states to safe havens where it can be blended down or converted - compelling failing and rogue states and eventually all states to destroy their nuclear bombs.
1600,savvy searchers fail to spot ads internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits. the report by the us pew research center reveals that % of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. it also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. the report reveals that % of net users say they regularly use google ask jeeves msn and yahoo when online. almost % of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden. according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about minutes per month carrying out separate searches and looks at . webpages for each hunt. a significant chunk of net users % carry out a search at least weekly and % of those asked only look every few weeks. for % of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find. search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. according to pew research % of searchers use just a single search engine % use two or three and a small number % consult more than three sites. tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. a small number % said they wouldn t really miss search engines if they did not exist. the remaining % said they could not live without search sites. more than two-thirds of those questioned % said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web. of those asked % were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search. only % of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. said the pew report: this finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results. commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference.
347,healthsouth ex-boss goes on trial the former head of us medical services firm healthsouth overstated earnings and assets to boost the company s share price it was claimed in court. richard scrushy is accused of directing a $. (£.) accounting fraud at the company he co-founded in alabama in . prosecutors said he was motivated by wealth - spending about $ between and while earning much less. defence lawyers said mr scrushy had been deceived by other executives. several former healthsouth employees have already pleaded guilty to fraud and are expected to give evidence against mr scrushy. we will present evidence that richard scrushy knew about the conspiracy that he participated in the conspiracy and that he profited prosecutor alice martin told the court. mr scrushy is the first chief executive to be tried for breaching the sarbanes oxley act - a law introduced in the wake of the enron and worldcom frauds which obliges corporate bosses to vouch for the accuracy of their companies results. among the charges he faces are conspiracy to commit fraud filing false statements and money laundering. after federal agents raided healthsouth s offices in march the company said none of its past financial statements could be relied on. the firm has since reorganised its board and management team and currently operates about health clinics.
1903,beastie boys win sampling battle us rappers beastie boys have won their long-running battle over the use of a sample in their song pass the mic. the punk-rappers used three notes of music from flautist james newton s choir in their track from . although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample mr newton said his copyright had been infringed. but the us court of appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition. the beastie boys - michael diamond adam horowitz and adam yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music. sampling now a standard practice among musicians involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song. a three-judge panel of the court held in that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of mr newton s recording. that finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the beastie boys. we hold that beastie boys use of a brief segment of that composition consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background c note is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of newton s copyright chief judge mary schroeder wrote in her opinion. mr newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist composer performer and university professor. mr newton and the beastie boys were not available for comment.
2214,bush budget seeks deep cutbacks president bush has presented his budget cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at $ (£) this year. the $. trillion (£. trillion) budget submitted to congress affects domestic programmes from farming to the environment education and health. but foreign aid is due to rise by % with more money to treat hiv/aids and reward economic and political reform. military spending is also set to rise by .% to reach $.. the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $ from congress later this year. congress will spend several months debating george w bush s proposal. the state department s planned budget would rise to just under $ - a fraction of the defence department s request - including almost $ to assist us allies in the war on terror . however the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle hiv/aids the bbc s jonathan beale reports and planned spending would almost double to $ with much of that money going to african nations. mr bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his millennium challenge corporation. the scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the us considers to be good governance and sound policies. yet mr bush s proposed spending of $ on that project is well below his initial promise of $. a key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration s proposed radical overhaul of social security the pensions programme on which many americans rely for their retirement income. some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to $. trillion over a -year period. neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the us emergency petroleum stockpile. concern over the level of the reserve created in has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. the bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil - rather than cash - from energy companies that drill under federal leases. the outline proposes reductions in budgets at out of government agencies including cuts of .% at agriculture and .% at the environmental protection agency. the spending plan for the year beginning october is banking on a healthy us economy to boost government income by .% to $. trillion. spending is forecast to grow by .% to $. trillion. but the budget is still the tightest yet under mr bush s presidency. in order to sustain our economic expansion we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government mr bush said in his budget message to congress. mr bush has promised to halve the us s massive budget deficit within five years. the deficit partly the result of massive tax cuts early in mr bush s presidency has been a key factor in pushing the us dollar lower. the independent congressional budget office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than $ by returning to the surpluses seen in the late by . but its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent in line with the promise when they were passed that they would sunset or disappear in . most republicans however want them to stay in place. and the figures also rely on the social security trust fund - the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions - being offset against the main budget deficit.
1570,donor attacks blair-brown feud the reported feud between tony blair and gordon brown has prompted a labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds. duncan bannatyne also attacked the government over iraq and its poor response to the asian tsunami crisis. his broadside came as ex-foreign secretary robin cook said he hoped mr brown would be premier at some point. mr bannatyne has previously given labour £ . he made his fortune from care homes and health clubs. the -year-old on tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of cabinet disunity and international issues. his spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give labour more money although he would remain a supporter and not fund the conservatives. robert peston s new book has prompted more speculation about the blair-brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in to stand down. mr bannatyne said: disunity in the cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country. gordon brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition. the businessman whose latest venture is a casino in newcastle also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in iraq. and he branded the uk government s response to the tsunami as piecemeal and poor . the people there need practical help not just pledges of money he said. the us has forces helping on the ground - we can do more. british navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. mr bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on business start-up programme dragon s den. but his spokesman insisted his attack on labour was not a publicity stunt. in a separate development robin cook gave his support to mr brown s prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be labour s election. but he insisted the recent squabbles between mr blair and mr brown were not perceived as a problem by the voters adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. mr cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was not an alternative source of opposition to the government . he warned the abstentions party was the real challenge to labour - and they would not be motivated by mr blair s promise to produce an unremittingly new labour election manifesto. his comments come after dave prentis the leader of britain s biggest union unison told the daily record newspaper he wants a date to be set for mr blair to be replaced as labour leader.
2095,souped-up wi-fi is on the horizon super high-speed wireless data networks could soon be in use in the uk. the government s wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called ultra wideband (uwb). ofcom wants to ensure that the arrival of uwb-using devices does not cause problems for those that already use the same part of the radio spectrum. uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home. the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second. uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let a person s gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. the technology works over a range up to metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. at the recent consumer electronics show in las vegas products with uwb chips built-in got their first public airing. currently use of uwb is only allowed in the uk under a strict licencing scheme. we re seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow uwb on a licence-exempt basis said a spokesman for ofcom. companies have until march to respond. in april the ec is due to start its own consultation on europe-wide adoption of uwb. the cross-europe body for radio regulators known as the european conference of postal and telecommunications administrations (cept) is carrying out research for this harmonisation programme. early sight of the cept work has caused controversy as some think it over-emphasises uwb s potential to interfere with existing users. by contrast a preliminary ofcom report found that it would be quite straight-forward to deploy uwb without causing problems for those that already use it. the ofcom spokesman said it was considering imposing a mask or set of technical restrictions on uwb-using devices. we would want these devices to have very strict controls on power levels so they can not transmit a long way or over a wide area he said. despite the current restrictions the technology is already being used. cambridge-based ubisense has about customers around the world using the short-range radio technology said david theriault standards and regulatory liaison for ubisense. he said that uwb was driving novel ways to interact with computers. it s like having a mouse all the time he said. he said that european decisions on what to do with uwb allied with ieee decisions on the exact specifications for it would help drive adoption. prior to its adoption as a way for gadgets and computers to communicate uwb was used as a sensing technology. it is used to spot such things as cracks under the surface of runways or to help firemen detect people through walls.
1517,tory backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards. the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week s commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a tough meeting where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move party sources told the bbc. the bill which ministers claim will tackle crime terrorism and illegal immigration is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats. they have said the scheme is deeply flawed and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been agnostic on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme. they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected. it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said. it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues concerns over id cards. the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it. the new chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists. what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.
562,cable offers video-on-demand cable firms ntl and telewest have both launched video-on-demand services as the battle between satellite and cable tv heats up. movies from sony pictures walt disney touchstone miramax columbia and buena vista will be among those on offer. the service is similar to sky plus as users can pause fast forward and rewind content but they cannot store programmes on their set top box - yet. it could sound the death knell for some tv channels telewest predicts. it allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over sky for the first time in many years said telewest chief executive eric tveter. video-on-demand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on tv. there will be less compromising around the tv schedule and some of the less popular channels may go by the wayside said philip snalune director of products at telewest. telewest customers in bristol and ntl viewers in glasgow will be the first to test the new service which sees a raft of movies on offer for hour rental. during the year the service will be extended to all cable regions. films will range in price from £ or £ for archived movies to £. for current releases. new releases initially on offer will include first dates kill bill: volume gothika and the station agent. in addition ntl is offering children s programmes adult content music video and concerts. telewest will launch similar services later in the year. ntl is also offering viewers the chance to catch up with programmes they have missed. its pick of the week service will offer a selection of bbc programmes from the previous seven days such as eastenders casualty top gear and antiques roadshow. the bbc is trialling a similar service offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their pc. for telewest it is the beginning of a £ investment in tv-on-demand which will also see the launch of a personal video recorder (pvr). pvr has been a big success for sky because it gives customers control over programmes. satellite customers without pvr cannot pause rewind or fast forward their programmes. with both services on offer from telewest mr tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial tv but also gain a huge competitive advantage over sky. we offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video-on-demand and pvr he said. video rental stores may also have to watch their back. video-on-demand is better than having a video-store in your living room and is more convenient he said. ntl said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a pvr but for the moment is concentrating on video-on-demand. pvr is a recording mechanism whereas what we are offering is truly on demand said a spokesman for the company. video-on-demand has the added advantage of not requiring a separate set-top box or extra remote controls he added. adam thomas an analyst at research firm informa media believes the time is ripe for video-on-demand to flourish. while sky will remain the dominant force in uk pay tv for some time to come ntl and telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of vod enthusiasm and if marketed correctly this could help them eat into sky s lead he said.
437,whitehall shredding increasing - tories civil servants have drastically stepped up the shredding of official documents figures compiled by the tories suggest. some government departments had doubled the number of documents being shredded ahead of the freedom of information act s implementation on january. departments for defence environment and trade which had all increased file destruction said they were following rules governing public records. but the tories want the information commissioner to investigate. the freedom of information act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for years. but bbc political correspondent james hardy said the prospect of outsiders poking their noses into the inner workings of whitehall appeared to be causing jitters among the mandarins. liberal democrat alan beith - who chairs the select committee which monitors the department of constitutional affairs - said if the claims were true whitehall was acting entirely against the spirit of the new act . both the information commissioner and the select committee will have to keep this issue under very close scrutiny. fellow lib dem norman baker said the episode painted an unflattering picture of the inner workings of government . it is clear that the government s initial enthusiasm for open government has turned to self-serving cynicism. dr julian lewis the conservative spokesman for the cabinet office said he had discovered a huge acceleration in shredding from a series of parliamentary answers. the department of work and pensions destroyed nearly files last year - up on four years ago when the act was passed. the number of files destroyed by the ministry of defence and the departments of environment food and rural affairs and trade and industry has also risen dramatically. dr lewis has called for an investigation by the information commissioner richard thomas. earlier this week mr thomas said he was looking into cabinet office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old. he said he totally condemned the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on january. government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served no current purpose mr thomas said. a cabinet office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or the destruction of important records . the freedom of information act will cover england wales and northern ireland from next year. similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about public bodies subject to various exemptions.

929,casual gaming to take off games aimed at casual players are set to be even bigger in according to industry experts. easy-to-play titles that do not require too much time and that are playable online or downloadable to mobile devices will see real growth in the coming year. the trend shows that gaming is not just about big-hitting games console titles which appeal more to hardcore gamers said a panel of experts. they were speaking before the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas which showcases the latest trends in gadgets and technologies for . the panel also insisted that casual gamers were not just women a common misconception which pervades current thinking about gamer demographics. casual games like poker pool bridge bingo and puzzle-based titles which can be played online or downloaded onto mobile devices were gender neutral and different genres attracted different players. greg mills program director at aol said its figures suggested that sports-based games attracted % of to -year-old males while puzzle games were played by % of females. games like bridge tended to attract the over- demographic of gamers. but hardcore gamers who are more attracted to blockbuster gamers which usually require hi-spec pcs like half-life or halo on xbox also liked to have a different type of gaming experience. when hardcore gamers are not playing halo they are playing poker and pool based on our research said geoff graber director of yahoo games which attracts about million gamers a month. with the growth of powerful pc technology and ownership broadband take-up portable players and mobile devices as well as interactive tv casual gaming is shaping up to be big business in according to the panel. the focus for the coming year should be about attracting third-party developers into the field to offer more innovative and multiplayer titles they agreed. we are at a time where we are on the verge of something much bigger said mr graber. casual games will get into their stride in will be really big in and will be about community. with more people finding more to do with their gadgets and high-speed connections casual games would start to open up the world of gaming as a form of mass-market entertainment to more people. key to these types of titles is the chance they give people who may not see themselves as gamers to dip in and out of games when they liked. portal sites which offer casual games like aol yahoo and realarcade as well as other games-on-demand services allow people to build up buddy lists so they can return and play against the same people. this aspect of community is crucial for gamers who just want to have quick access to free or cheap games without committing long periods of time immersed in £ to £ console or pc titles said the panel. about people are expected to attend the ces trade show which stretches over more than . million square feet and which officially runs from to january. the main theme is how new devices are getting better at talking to each other allowing people to enjoy digital content like audio video and images when they want and where they want.
230,tv show unites angolan families angolan families who are attempting to track each other down after being separated by nearly years of war are succeeding thanks to a hugely popular tv show. meeting point has become one of tv angola s most watched programmes and has reunited hundreds of families. it runs daily not only on the television but also on the radio. every friday hundreds of people gather in luanda s independence square to record a message in front of the tv cameras in the hope that a lost relative will see it. many relatives have been reunited on air. at the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge huge crowds sergio gera the programme s chief co-ordinator told bbc world service s assignment programme. now things are a little calmer there are slightly less people - but after two and a half years of broadcasting there are still a lot of people going. the media in the southern african country twice the size of france has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives. hundreds of thousands of people died in angola s -year civil war which finally ended in and tens of thousands of people are still missing. many have not heard anything for or more years - in all % of angolan families have lost someone. the idea of recording in independence square was modelled on a square in the argentine capital buenos aries where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing and to exchange news. one woman victoria lapete found her sister - the only remaining member of her family - in independence square live on meeting point. she had not seen her sibling for years. when we saw each other we threw ourselves into each other s arms she told assignment. we started to cry. i felt very very happy because i d spent so long without any family. suddenly i had a sister again. however angola is one of the poorest countries in africa and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few. this means that elsewhere in the country the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the international committee of the red cross (icrc). in the city of wambo the icrc runs the gazetta - a -page tabloid-size book which contains names of missing or displaced. their task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country. it s very difficult - there are many displaced stated joaquim sahundi head of tracing in wambo. as they try to go back [home] others are trying to relocate their relatives. many people are getting injured because of that - in the villages in the bush there has been no clearance of mines. when people are crossing these areas they step on mines. the icrc also uses the media where it can running four daily broadcasts of their lists of the missing on radio angola. meanwhile there remain massive challenges to angolan families even once they are reunited. the programme of family reunification is extremely important but for these families to remain reunified there has to be social integration job access education healthcare said rafael marques of the pro-democracy george soros foundation for southern africa. essentially the government is waiting for the international community to pay for the reconstruction - that s why it has been persistently calling for a donor s conference. that is just a way of detaching itself from its political responsibilities.
668,sec to rethink post-enron rules the us stock market watchdog s chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new us corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms. in a speech at the london school of economics william donaldson promised several initiatives . european firms have protested that us laws introduced after the enron scandal make wall street listings too costly. the us regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the sarbanes-oxley act. the act comes into force in mid-. it obliges all firms with us stock market listings to make declarations which critics say will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts. firms that break the new law could face huge fines while senior executives risk jail terms of up to years. mr donaldson said that although the act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms the securities and exchange commission (sec) would continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements . there are few if any who disagree with the intentions of the act which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. but european firms with secondary listings in new york have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. the act also applies to firms with more than us shareholders a situation many firms without us listings could find themselves in. the -shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy a delisting. mr donaldson said the sec would consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process for foreign firms unwilling to meet us requirements. we should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections without turning the us market into one with no exit he said. he revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the act s least popular measure - section - for foreign firms. seen as particularly costly to implement section obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm s internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. the sec has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including us ones - with market capitalisations below $ (£). a delegation of european firms visited the sec in december to press for change the financial times reported. it was led by digby jones director general of the uk s confederation of british industry (cbi) and included representatives of basf siemens and cadbury schweppes. compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of us listings. air china picked the london stock exchange for its secondary listing in its $. (£) stock market debut last month. there are also rumours that two chinese state-run banks - china construction bank and bank of china - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in new york later this year. instead the cost of sarbanes-oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in hong kong according to press reports in china.

2159,wal-mart is sued over rude lyrics the parents of a -year-old girl are suing us supermarket giant wal-mart over a cd by rock group evanescence that contains swear words. the lawsuit filed in washington county alleges wal-mart deceived customers by not putting warning labels on the cover. trevin skeens alleges wal-mart knew of the offending word because it had censored it on its music sales website. wal-mart said it was investigating the claims but had no plans to pull the cd. wal-mart has a policy of not stocking cds which carry parental advisory labels. mr skeens said he bought the anywhere but home cd for his daughter and was shocked to hear the swearing when it was played in their car. i don t want any other families to get this expecting it to be clean. it needs to be removed from the shelves to prevent other children from hearing it said mr skeens of brownsville. the lawsuit seeks to force wal-mart to censor the music or remove it from its stores in maryland. it also seeks damages of up to $ (£ ) for every customer who bought the cd at maryland wal-marts and also naming record label wind-up records and distributor bmg entertainment in the legal action. while wal-mart sets high standards it would not be possible to eliminate every image word or topic that an individual might find objectionable wal-mart spokesman guy whitcomb told the herald-mail of hagerstown.

1726,computer grid to help the world your computer can now help solve the world s most difficult health and social problems. launched this week the world community grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. the donated processor cycles will help the wcg create virtual supercomputers via the net. the idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop pcs. one of the most successful collaboration projects was seti run by the search for extra terrestrial life project which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication. anyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the wgc website. once installed the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process and reports back after completing that task. the first wcg problem being tackled will be the human proteome folding project which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold. the subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences and technology. the body will evaluate proposals from leading research public and not-for-profit organizations and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. organisations also represented on the board include the united nations development programme and the world health organisation. the world community grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues said elain gallin program director for medical research at the doris duke charitable foundation. [it] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems she added. ibm has donated the hardware software technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid. the computer company working with united devices previously developed the smallpox research grid which linked together more than two million volunteers from countries to speed the analysis of some million drug molecules in the search for a treatment for smallpox.
2031,hi-tech posters guide commuters interactive posters are helping londoners get around the city during the festive season. when interrogated with a mobile phone the posters pass on a number that people can call to get information about the safest route home. sited at busy underground stations the posters are fitted with an infra-red port that can beam information directly to a handset. the posters are part of transport for london s safe travel at night campaign. the campaign is intended to help londoners especially women avoid trouble on the way home. in particular it aims to cut the number of sexual assaults by drivers of unlicensed minicabs. nigel marson head of group marketing at transport for london (tfl) said the posters were useful because they work outside the mobile phone networks. they can work in previously inaccessible areas such as underground stations which is obviously a huge advantage in a campaign of this sort he said. the posters will automatically beam information to any phone equipped with an ir port that is held close to the glowing red icon on the poster. we started with infra-red because there are a huge number ir phones out there said rachel harker spokeswoman for hypertag which makes the technology fitted to the posters. it s a well established technology. hypertag is also now making a poster that uses short-range bluetooth radio technology to swap data. although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number ms harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images ring tones and video clips. she said that there are no figures for how many people are using the posters but a previous campaign run for a cosmetics firm racked up interactions. before we ran a campaign there was a big question mark of: if we build it will they come she said. now we know that yes they will. the tfl campaign using the posters will run until boxing day.
2024,blair blasts tory spending plans tony blair has launched an attack on conservative spending plans saying they are a ludicrous improbability . the prime minister has told a labour party gathering that the tory policies would cause economic failure. tory leader michael howard has said his party would cut £ in wasteful spending to allow £ in tax cuts. on saturday tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing inefficiencies which had burgeoned under labour. in his speech mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party which had learned to occupy the political centre ground with a hidebound tory party which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. mr blair said: the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk both britain s hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages inflation unemployment for decades - and the key investment in public services. i believe that the tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it s possible to imagine he said. it s a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in years of conservative government. mr blair added: they the conservatives have learned nothing. by contrast he said new labour had listened to its electorate and changed. mr blair went on to list his government s achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. so now we have a choice we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. and i say we have to fight. in response david davis said the tories would make cuts such as removing regional assemblies but would bring in more police officers and match labour s spending on health and education. everybody knows having lived through this government the last seven years that they faced lots of stealth tactics lots of increases in taxes but no improvement in public services he said. mr davis said labour had been responsible for huge waste huge overspending not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy . the public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government less waste and lower taxes with a tory government he concluded. gordon brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. the chancellor said the conservatives plans would see some £ in spending cuts by which the tories deny. mr brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be distracted or diverted . according to an advance text released by officials he told delegates: we must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them. mr brown warned that the tories were planning the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto . meanwhile tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of misrepresenting the party s proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans. he still cannot accept the simple truth which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes mr letwin said. once again mr blair and his chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £ shortfall in their plans
314,two nigerian banks set to merge nigerian banks united bank of africa and standard trust bank have agreed plans to merge and create the biggest bank in west africa. the deal is also in line with a directive from the nigerian central bank that called for more consolidation in the nation s crowded banking sector. the merger was announced in a statement on standard trust s website on tuesday but no financial details were revealed. united bank is the third biggest in nigeria in terms of number of branches. standard trust is smaller but more profitable. the boards of united bank and standard trust at separate meetings yesterday approved arrangements to merge both institutions standard trust said. standard trust is % nigerian-owned but united bank has some foreign investors including new york-based global depository receipts (.%) and banca nazionale del lavoro and monte del paschi di siena both from italy who each have a .% stake.
797,kenyan school turns to handhelds at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus. they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. it is a pilot project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e-slates. the e-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. the data is transmitted alongside audio signals. the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e-slates. it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. it also stores this on its hard disc. the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. it s very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but it s also a one-way connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult. the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux-based system. the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions. users can scroll through these sections independently of each other. eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world s largest university libraries. all books in the public domain something like million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions. we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the e-slates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working. maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the e-slates says the project s ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting - as they need it most.

268,ex-boeing director gets jail term an ex-chief financial officer at boeing has received a four-month jail sentence and a fine of $ (£ ) for illegally hiring a top air force aide. michael sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting darleen druyun while she still handled military contracts. ms druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring boeing when awarding lucrative contracts. boeing lost a $ government contract after a pentagon inquiry into the case. the contract to provide refuelling tankers for the us air force was cancelled last year. the pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $ which it believes may have been tainted by ms druyun s role in the procurement process. boeing sacked mr sears and ms druyun in november after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy. ms druyun had talks with mr sears in october about working for boeing while she was still a top procurement official within the pentagon. she subsequently joined the company in january . ms druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to boeing and other favoured companies. in documents filed in a virginia court ahead of mr sears sentencing prosecutors blamed boeing s senior management for failing to ask key questions about the legal and ethical issues surrounding ms druyun s appointment. mr sears told prosecutors that no other boeing officials were aware that ms druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with boeing. however analysts believe boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. the pentagon has investigated contracts dating back to since the allegations against ms druyun came to light. boeing s corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. boeing was sued by lockheed martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a contract competition. boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures. the pentagon subsequently revoked $ worth of contracts assigned to boeing and prohibited the seattle-based company from future rocket work.
1321,us retail sales surge in december us retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in december boosted by strong car sales. seasonally adjusted sales rose .% in the month compared to .% a month earlier boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after christmas. sales climbed % for the year the best performance since an .% rise in the commerce department added. the gains were led by a .% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. dealers were forced to cut prices in december to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started. the increase in sales during december pushed total spending for the month to $. (£.). sales for the year also broke through the $ trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $. trillion however if automotives are excluded from december s data retail sales rose just .% on the month. home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well rising .%. but as well as hitting the shops more us consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by .%. however analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the federal reserve bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises. consumers for now remain willing to spend freely sustaining the us expansion. given that attitude the fed remains likely to continue boosting the fed funds rate at upcoming meetings ubs economist maury harris told reuters. retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the us. consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during and as the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade and the world trade centre attacks. during that time sales grew a lacklustre .% in and .% a year later. looking ahead analysts now expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the high street with consumer spending remaining strong. the belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. the number of americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to the highest rate since september. however long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since .
1062,a question of trust and technology a major government department is without e-mail for a week and technology analyst bill thompson wants to know what happened. a couple of weeks ago i wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days. it seems that thousands of civil servants at the uk s department of work and pensions went through the same thing last week. it has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way depriving staff of e-mail and access to the application software they use to calculate people s benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances. senior consultants from eds the computer firm which manage the system and microsoft which supplied the software were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all while staff resorted to phone fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done. fortunately the back-office systems which actually pay people their money were still working so only new claims and updates were affected done properly. this is bad enough for those affected but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners. i am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans. although the full story has not yet been told it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows to windows xp went wrong and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network. this is certainly unfortunate but i have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved. today s computer networks are large complex and occasionally fragile. the interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems. it is the network equivalent of godel s theorem - any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically. so i will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck. what is really disturbing and cannot be excused is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press. it is without a doubt a major story and was the second or third lead item on bbc radio s today programme throughout friday morning. so why did not the prime minister s official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before friday why was not the pensions minister in parliament to make an emergency statement on tuesday when it was clear that there was a serious problem if there had been an outbreak of legionnaire s disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment. while eds and microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lessons to learn from their week of pain we can learn some political lessons too. and the most important is that in this digital world technology failures are matters of public interest not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice care or understand. that means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it. it would be unacceptable for any of the parties involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege. a major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently. anything less is a betrayal of public trust. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.
2078,horror film heads us box office a low-budget horror film produced by evil dead director sam raimi has topped the north american box office. boogeyman which focuses on a man who returns to his childhood home to confront his traumatic past took $. (£.) in three days. last week s chart-topper the robert de niro thriller hide and seek fell to number four. other new entries included the wedding date a comedy starring will and grace s debra messing at number two. the road-trip comedy are we there yet and multiple oscar nominee million dollar baby completed the top five. other oscar contenders including the aviator and sideways continued to perform strongly at the box office. the aviator has taken $ (£) so far while sideways has taken $. (£.) in a more limited release. boogeyman which cost just $ (£.) to make performed well even though it was not screened to critics before release - normally a sign that a film will get bad reviews or perform poorly at the box office. i certainly believe it s a genre where people are going to be more moved by the marketing materials for the movie than by what the critics say said rory bruer head of distribution for sony pictures which released the film in the us. overall the weekend box office was strong despite the fact that it was american football s super bowl weekend - a time when cinema admissions generally fall. this year the top films grossed around $ (£.) compared to s super bowl weekend when the total box office was $. (£.).
643,rusedski angry over supplements greg rusedski has criticised the governing body of men s tennis for not releasing contamination-free supplements in time for the new season. rusedski said: i tried to order some but didn t receive any and i haven t got any yet. you would think they would have been available in december as it can take two months for the body to respond. this event comes in the hottest period of the year so you would hope the stuff would be available for it. the british number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated atp supplements. in response the atp struck a deal with pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to provide contamination-free drinks and nutritional bars for the men s tour. david higdon vice president of the atp admitted: i agree with greg. i would have loved to have had these things available as soon as possible but it s a lot of work to make sure they have gone through rigorous testing. the reality is though that the first two weeks of the tour are spread far and wide and part of the distribution agreement we had with gsk has an education component. we weren t going to just drop these products out there without having a talk with the players about understanding how to use them. the first chance we will get to do that is at the players meeting on the saturday before the australian open. and rusedski who takes on roger federer at the qatar open later on wednesday conceded that the imminent changes will be beneficial. the good thing is that there is now a % guarantee so hopefully all this will never happen again said rusedski. hopefully after the australian open we won t have to discuss this any more.
647,straw backs ending china embargo uk foreign secretary jack straw has defended plans to end the european union s arms embargo on china despite opposition from the us and japan. mr straw visiting beijing noted arms embargoes applied to china burma and zimbabwe but not to north korea which he said had a terrible rights record. the eu imposed its arms ban on china in after troops opened fire on protestors in tiananmen square. mr straw also signed a deal on china-uk tourism. it is expected this would increase the number of chinese tourists by per year providing $ in revenue. china has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons. mr straw speaking at a joint news conference with chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing stressed this point. the result of any decision [to lift the arms embargo] should not be an increase in arms exports from european union member states to china either in quantitative or qualitative terms mr straw said. earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within six months. but mr straw faces tough opposition to the move. tory foreign affairs spokesman michael ancram said lifting the arms embargo would be irresponsible and would damage britain s relations with the us. he said mr straw was naive beyond belief if he accepted china s claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons. the french want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to china; the chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from europe. when he was in tokyo earlier this week japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura told the british minister that his plan to remove the embargo was a worrying issue that concerns the security and environment of not only japan but also east asia overall . washington argues that if the embargo is lifted it could lead to a buying spree for arms that china could use to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan. beijing says taiwan is part of chinese territory and wants to unite it with the mainland by force if necessary. the us is bound by law to help taiwan defend itself. washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in china have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo. it is an issue raised by human rights groups too. brad adams from the uk s human rights watch said: this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square. but mr straw insisted the eu s code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.
1676,gurkhas to help tsunami victims britain has offered to send a company of gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in indonesia downing street said. the deployment would involve troops from the battalion royal gurkha rifles based in brunei. discussions have begun with indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment but the government said the offer was aimed at the aceh province. downing st said a similar offer might be made to the sri lankan government. however a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in indonesia which the gurkhas might be able to help with. the spokesman said: following this morning s daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort the government has formally offered the indonesian government the assistance of a company of british army gurkhas from battalion royal gurkha rifles around personnel and two helicopters. this is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the indian ocean. indonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami with of the confirmed deaths so far. international development minister gareth thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of aceh. we have offered the gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort particularly in aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the indian ocean at the moment he said. we ve also had raf aircraft flying in equipment which the un desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in aceh province as well. the offer comes as the foreign secretary jack straw arrives in indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.

254,crucial decision on super-casinos a decision on whether to allow westminster to legislate on super-casinos is set to be made by the scottish parliament. the government has plans for up to eight las vegas style resorts in the uk one of which is likely to be in glasgow. scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super-casino will be built in scotland. but opposition parties say that will not happen in practice. the vote is due to be taken on wednesday and is expected to be close. the scottish executive believes that the legislation should be handled by westminster. the new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved. a super-casino in glasgow could be located at ibrox or the scottish exhibition and conference centre. the new gambling bill going through westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. but the scottish national party and the tories say the issue of super-casinos should be decided in scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility.
667,dvd copy protection strengthened dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision. the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most but not all of the current dvd ripping (copying) programs used to pirate dvds. ripguard is designed to... reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer said the firm. macrovision said the new technology will work in nearly all current dvd players when applied to the discs but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard. some bbc news website users have expressed concerns that the new technology will mean that dvds will not work on pcs running the operating system linux. the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales. the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last months taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download. ultimately we see ripguard dvd... evolving beyond anti-piracy and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions interoperability in tomorrow s digital home and the upcoming high-definition formats said steve weinstein executive vice president and general manager of macrovision s entertainment technologies group. macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against rent rip and return - where people would rent a dvd copy it and then return the original. ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of the company said. the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used those programs will now most likely crash the company said. macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures.
237,brewers profits lose their fizz heineken and carlsberg two of the world s largest brewers have reported falling profits after beer sales in western europe fell flat. dutch firm heineken saw its annual profits drop % and warned that earnings in may also slide. danish brewer carlsberg suffered a % fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs. both are looking to russia and china to provide future growth as western european markets are largely mature. heineken s net income fell to euros ($; £) during from euro a year ago. it blamed weak demand in western europe and currency losses. it had warned in september that the weakening us dollar which has cut the value of foreign sales would knock euros off its operating profits. despite the dip in profits heineken s sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was euros up .% from . euros in . heineken said it now plans to invest euros in aggressive and high-impact marketing in europe and the us in . heineken which also owns the amstel and murphy s stout brands said it would also seek to cut costs. this may involve closing down breweries. heineken increased its dividend payment by % to euro cents but warned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in net profit. carlsberg the world s fifth-largest brewer saw annual pre-tax profits fall to . danish kroner ( euros). its beer sales have been affected by the sluggish european economy and by the banning of smoking in pubs in several european countries. nevertheless total sales increased % to kroner thanks to strong sales of carlsberg lager in russia and poland. carlsberg is more optimistic than heineken about projecting a % rise in net profits for the year. however it also plans to cut jobs in sweden where sales have been hit by demand for cheap imported brands. we remain cautious about the medium-to-long term outlook for revenue growth across western europe for a host of economic social and structural reasons investment bank merrill lynch said of carlsberg.
1107,blair stresses prosperity goals tony blair says his party s next manifesto will be unremittingly new labour and aimed at producing personal prosperity for all . the prime minister is trying to draw a line under speculation over the state of his relationship with gordon brown with the speech in chatham kent. he is saying that prosperity means both individual wealth and ensuring radically improved public services. he is also claiming labour is more ideologically united than ever. mr brown is currently touring africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with downing street. with the election widely predicted for may angry labour mps this week warned mr blair and mr brown about the dangers of disunity. now mr blair is trying to put the focus on the substance of labour s platform for a third term in government. labour made low inflation unemployment and mortgage rates the centrepiece of a new poster campaign this week. and on thursday mr blair is saying: i want to talk about the central purpose ofnew labour - which is to increase personal prosperity and well-being not justfor a few but for all. by prosperity i mean both the income and wealth of individuals and theirfamilies and the opportunity and security available to them through radicallyimproved public services and a reformed welfare state. the tories are trying to capitalise on the apparent feud at the top of government. on wednesday they unveiled a poster which pictured the prime minister and mr brown under the words how can they fight crime when they are fighting each other michael howard and frontbencher john redwood on thursday launched new plans to abolish hundreds of quangos. they say government is spending too much and lower taxes are needed to make britain more competitive. the liberal democrats have also claimed infighting its obstructing good government. the latest speculation about relations between new labour s two most powerful figures came after the publication of a new book brown s britain by robert preston. in it he alleges that mr blair told mr brown in he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election. the book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from cabinet allies and suspicion that mr brown was manoeuvring against him. mr peston s book claimed that mr brown told mr blair: there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe. on wednesday mr blair directly denied mr brown made that quote and before he left for africa on tuesday the chancellor told reporters: of course i trust the prime minister.

1097,ask jeeves joins web log market ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs. the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read search and share all the blogs they are interested in. ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed. bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication (rss) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. google acquired pyra labs makers of the blogger software in . in msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. jim lanzone vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it. the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers he said. mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask s my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites he said. it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates. there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines said mr lanzone. our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away he said. though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right said mr lanzone. rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders.

190,kinnock to urge reform in lords neil kinnock has said his acceptance of a seat in the house of lords will allow him to help achieve further progress with substantial democratic reform. on the bbc s breakfast with frost it was put to mr kinnock that he had once referred to lords members as brigands muggers bribers and gangsters . but the outgoing european commissioner said his comments - made some years ago - needed to be put in context. he said advocates for reform needed to be inside the lords to vote for it. it was pointed out to me that if the additional democratic reform is going to take place it is going to require advocates in the lords and people there willing to vote for it. mr kinnock added that the second factor behind his acceptance of the peerage was his appointment as chairman of the british council. history demonstrates that it s immensely useful for the british council to have its chairman in the house of lords and that was a conclusive factor. mr kinnock said he thought about the decision for quite a long time because he had long had reservations about the lords. but he added: the process of reform has developed substantially but not sufficiently and consequently i did take all these factors into consideration because it s not a decision to be made glibly. the former labour leader said he would probably take the title of lord kinnock of bedwellty - his first constituency for which he was selected in .

1649,us trade gap ballooned in october the us trade deficit widened by more than expected in october hitting record levels after higher oil prices raised import costs figures have shown the trade shortfall was $. (£) up % from september the commerce department said. that pushed the month deficit to $.. imports rose by .% while exports increased by only .%. a weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports though this should help drive export demand in coming months. things are getting worse but that s to be expected said david wyss of standard & poor s in new york. the first thing is that when the dollar goes down it increases the price of imports. we are seeing improved export orders. things seem to be going in the right direction. despite this optimism significant concerns remain as to how the us will fund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen. another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with china which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports. the us imported almost $ worth of goods from china during october exporting a little under $. it seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains said anthony crescenzi a bond strategist at miller tabak in new york. the trade deficit and the shortfall with china are big issues going forward . the commerce department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite widespread expectations that the federal reserve will raise interest rates for a fifth time this year. borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to .% at a fed meeting later on tuesday.

471,parry puts gerrard above money listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from gmt. but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future. he told bbc five live: steven is above money. he is the future of liverpool. it doesn t matter if it s £ £ or £ we will not accept offers. but we are also realistic enough to know we can t keep steven against his will. on the subject of liverpool s finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium. and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan. parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july from a similar role at the premier league. there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield - and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard. on the subject of liverpool s captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes. he said: they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same - steven is not for sale. but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said: i sincerely hope he will be. steven knows my views. he knows rafa s views. we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him. we crave success as much as he does. we know he s ambitious and nobody can argue with that. i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he d like to do anything else. we all want to see progress by next season. he s not alone in that. there are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim. it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a £-plus bid in the summer - but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. there have been a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths. it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. we didn t had an offer last summer parry explained. we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn t want to sell him. in reality it didn t go beyond that. maybe there will be an offer in the summer. maybe there won t. our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will. that just doesn t work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way we ve decided to sell you is not on the agenda. you can forget that. parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool s new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in . and he confessed arsenal s £ deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the anfield club serious food for thought. he said: i have to say historically it is something i have been against and i have been on record as saying that but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye-opener. i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn t even been worth contemplating. but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow - that s interesting. my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium. some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but parry countered: i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell. i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to. that s not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but i think it is clearly something we have to explore. on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east. that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained: steve has never been used as a stalking horse. there s no need and that is not the way we do business. we had discussions with steve over the course of . i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn t happen. quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it. we are still evaluating it. steve s interest was taken very much on its own merits. his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isn t closed on anything. we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year. we have a common interest in making liverpool successful. that s a dream we all share so as far as i m concerned the door is not closed. i would take £ if we had no investment but if we did keep him. as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really £ for gerrard i don t care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard s quality. through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do. critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard. ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. i am hoping he doesn t walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash. £ realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it. i would however be happy with gerrard s transfer for any fee over £. parry s statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. upping the ante is another smart move by parry. i would keep gerrard. no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed. the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. clearly if he isn t then we would be foolish not to sell. the worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football.
1741,us state acts to stop spammers us state texas has filed a lawsuit against two men believed to be among the world s top five spammers. it is seeking millions of dollars in damages in a civil lawsuit filed earlier this week. the texas attorney general said it started the legal action as messages sent by the alleged spammers broke three laws governing e-mail marketing. the company named in the lawsuit denied any wrongdoing and said it complied with all relevant laws. the texas lawsuit was filed against ryan samuel pitylak a university oftexas student and mark stephen trotter of california. both are thought to be the top executives in three companies - payperaction llc. leadplex llc. and leadplex inc - that are suspected of sending out many millions of unwanted e-mail messages. illegal spam must be stopped said greg abbott texas attorney general announcing the legal action. spam is one of the most aggravating and pervasive problems facing consumers today. the attorney general alleges that messages sent by mr pitylak and mr trotter s companies broke the controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act (can-spam) as well as the texas electronic mail and solicitation act and texas deceptive trade practices act. all three acts confer cash penalties for each violation of their terms. if the men are found guilty and all penalties are applied the two men could face a damages bill running into millions. mr abbott said the messages sent by the pair broke laws by using misleading subject lines not identifying themselves as adverts and offering services for which they had no licence to do so in texas. lawyers for the alleged spammers said the lawsuit was groundless and the two men would defend themselves strongly against the accusations. leadplex and payperaction are legitimate internet marketing companies that are in complete compliance with the federal can-spam act said lin hughes speaking on behalf of mr pitylak and mr trotter. in a similar move the us federal trade commission (ftc) has won a court order that stops an international group of spammers sending sexually explicit e-mail. the ftc took the action because the messages being sent violated several parts of the can-spam act. in particular the pornographic messages did not identify themselves as being sexually explicit had deceptive subject headings did not have working opt-out mechanisms failed to mention they were adverts and did not give the sender s real world address. the court order stops the spammers sending e-mail and freezes assets prior to a hearing on a permanent injunction.

1244,uk house prices dip in november uk house prices dipped slightly in november the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) has said. the average house price fell marginally to £ from £ in october. recent evidence has suggested that the uk housing market is slowing after interest rate increases and economists forecast a drop in prices during . but while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market annual house price inflation is still strong up .% in the year to november. economists however forecast that odpm figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months. overall the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data said mark miller at hbos treasury services. the odpm data is a fairly lagging indicator. the figures come after the bank of england said the number of mortgages approved in the uk has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. the halifax meanwhile said last week that house prices increased by .% in december - the first monthly rise since september. the uk s biggest mortgage lender said prices rose .% over the whole of but by only .% in the second half of the year. it is predicting a % fall in overall prices in as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years. the odpm attributed the monthly fall of prices in november to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats. it said annual inflation rose between october and november because prices had fallen by .% in the same period in . the odpm data showed the average house price was £ in england; £ in wales; £ in scotland and £ in northern ireland. all areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in november except for northern ireland and the west midlands where the rate was unchanged the odpm said. the north east showed the highest rate of inflation at .% followed by yorkshire and the humber on .% and the north west on .%. the east midlands the west midlands and the south west all had an annual inflation rate of more than %. in london the area with the highest average house price at £ annual inflation rose only slightly in november to .% from % the previous month.
1232,arsenal through on penalties arsenal win - on penalties the spanish goalkeeper saved from alan quinn and jon harley as arsenal sealed a quarter-final trip to bolton with a - victory on penalties. lauren patrick vieira freddie ljungberg and ashley cole scored for arsenal while andy gray and phil jagielka were on target for the blades. michael tonge and harley wasted chances for the underdogs but paddy kenny was inspired to keep arsenal at bay. arsenal stripped of attacking talent such as thierry henry and dennis bergkamp partnered -year-old italian striker arturo lupoli with ljungberg up front. it was a revamped arsenal line-up and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as tonge wasted a glorious chance. gray ran free down the right flank and his cross left tonge with the simplest of chances but he blazed over the top from six yards. arsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening minutes although ljungberg turned a half-chance wide after good work by cesc fabregas. arsene wenger introduced quincy owusu-abeyie for the ineffective lupoli at half-time and the pacy dutch youngster had an immediate impact. he ran clear after good work by mathieu flamini but his finish was tame and kenny saved easily. owusu-abeyie then fired in a testing cross which was met by fabregas and it needed a desperate clearance by kenny s legs to save the blades. arsenal were now totally dominant and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after minutes when fabregas crashed a rising drive against the bar from yards. it then took a brilliant tackle by jagielka to deny ljungberg as he was poised to strike. arsenal continued to press and once again kenny was called into action with eight minutes left diving low to clutch another close-range effort from fabregas. neil warnock s side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when derek geary s cross found harley at the far post but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by almunia. owusu-abeyie s pace was causing all sorts of problems for the blades and as extra-time began another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for ljungberg. pascal cygan missed arsenal s best chance after minutes blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post. arsenal sent on jeremie aliadiere with seven minutes of extra-time left and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch. kolo toure s misplaced free-kick landed at his feet but kenny once again blocked from a tight angle. arsenal laid siege to sheffield united s goal in the dying minutes but they somehow held on to force penalties. almunia was then arsenal s hero as another brave blades cup campaign came to a losing end. kenny geary morgan bromby harley liddell montgomery jagielka thirlwell tonge (quinn ) gray. subs not used: francis kabba shaw haystead. morgan. almunia lauren cygan senderos cole fabregas (toure ) vieira flamini (aliadiere ) clichy lupoli (owusu-abeyie ) ljungberg. subs not used: eboue taylor. clichy lauren senderos. p dowd (staffordshire).
1362,mobile multimedia slow to catch on there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular. consumers swapping old phones for slinkier dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a % increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of according to analysts gartner more than million handsets were sold between july and september a period that according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is seldom strong . but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps sounds and video clips few so far are taking the chance to do so. in fact the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures audio and video is growing. figures gathered by continental research shows that % of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (mms) up from % in . this is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to . million. getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying. the problem they face said shailendra jain head of mms firm adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets. also he said they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it. research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to. according to continental research % of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation. only % regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people s reluctance to start sending them said mr jain. they ask themselves: if i m streaming video from one handset to another will it work he said. there s a lot of user apprehension about that. there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might. andrew bud executive chairman of messaging firm mblox said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system. the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant he said. the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users. no-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped said mr bud. this has led to operators finding other technologies particularly one known as wap-push to get multimedia to their customers. but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers the results can be dramatic. israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth. one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india the largest mobile firm in the country. the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. while not multimedia messaging such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content. as a result % of the subscribers to the hutch alive which uses celltick s broadcast technology regularly click for more pictures sounds and images from the operator. operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers said yaron toren spokesman for celltick. until then multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.
1556,reboot ordered for eu patent law a european parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new european union rules which govern computer-based inventions. the legal affairs committee (juri) said the commission should re-submit the computer implemented inventions directive after meps failed to back it. it has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open-source software innovation. supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions. the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words computer implemented invention . the draft law suffered setbacks when poland one of the largest eu member states rejected its adoption twice in two months. intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure. only two meps backed the draft law at the juri meeting with one voting to abstain. opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the eu a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states. in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its one-click shopping service for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.
1501,broadband soars in if broadband were a jumbo jet then would have seen it taxiing down the runway firing up its engines and preparing for take-off. but this year has seen it soar. in the spring it literally took to the skies as lufthansa and british airways trialled it on flights. this perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology rather than how useful sky-high broadband would actually be. it was flying high and by the autumn five million britons had signed up for high-speed net access at home. such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million or more than % of homes. the two key factors in whetting people s appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push. when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard broadband for less than £ at the beginning of the year it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached - broadband had truly gone mass market. a feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market take-up of dial-up. broadband for less than £ was even touted by some firms although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models. for those who became broadbanders in there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities. the rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access to the tune of million connections worldwide by april prompting research firm point topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever. by september the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dial-up and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every seconds. broadband was being mentioned on the o clock news and in the tabloids; the sun even carried a cartoon joke about it. but two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines. in may bt quietly announced that it was shaving % off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges so-called local loop unbundling. the vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes. at the moment bt has a stranglehold on more than % of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what adsl products get into homes. with cheaper local loop unbundling rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise-like. it will mean the uk will finally catch up with countries such as france and the netherlands where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to (megabits per second). and the major price fall means that rather than just talk about it companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into bt s exchanges. it may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the northern ireland peace talks - fraught bitter and with no end in sight. another big piece of news for broadband users in was the extension of bt s reach meaning more than % of the population could get broadband regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived. there was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to broadband they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband-enabled exchange. for thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology the news meant they could finally join in. broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had a bumper year. the biggest news for them was increased speeds introducing and services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on . the cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route. broadband can seem confusing for consumers with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set-up fees. it is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in but remains a plane worth catching. as it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride.
476,new foot and mouth action urged a senior tory mp has criticised agriculture department defra s lackadaisical approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak. public accounts committee chairman edward leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. the national audit office said defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. but mr leigh said the department was dragging its heels . that comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. he also said defra had been dreadfully slow in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis. the outbreak which began in led to the slaughter of . million animals devastated many farms and rural businesses and is estimated to have cost the uk up to £. four years after the outbreak defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors costs and £ of invoices remain unpaid mr leigh said. mr leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an it system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. in november it emerged european commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the uk government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis. ministers had hoped to get £ from the european union vet fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £. that was because the uk had valued the culled animals at between two and three times the commission s assessment of their likely market value. national audit office chief sir john bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. on the issue of the unpaid invoices sir john said defra had paid % of the £. submitted by contractors since but has not agreed a final settlement with contractors pending the results of its investigations . mr leigh said being better prepared would also help avoid the need for mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the outbreak . a defra spokesman said: we welcome the report. it acknowledges the progress the department has made since - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. however the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.
1408,media gadgets get moving pocket-sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in according to industry experts. last year saw the emergence of portable media players such as the windows-based creative zen portable media player the samsung yepp the iriver pmc- and the archos series among others. but this year they are set to get smarter and more connected to allow people to find more video to watch on them. archos launched its latest range of its linux-based portable media devices at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on friday. dubbed the pocket media assistant it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time. consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access said henri crohas chief of archos. and now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time. archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people s pockets after the mobile. unlike windows-based players the archos series devices have always been able to record from any video source such as tvs as well as playback. the content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device. recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it. and wi-fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high-speed wireless link. archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device. microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at ces primarily for us consumers though. it has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company tivo which bill gates also showcased in his keynote speech at ces. the tivo to go service means that us consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their tivos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the windows-based portable media players or smartphones. it also said it had launched a service with mtv to let people watch comedy central and country music tv on its devices. and a service is launching with msn to provide people with shortened versions of news entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the pc onto the portable devices. but the ability to record directly from tv vcr and digital cable and satellite boxes which windows-based devices do not offer certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too. the increased capability of these devices and the content deals that are being done may go some way to persuading people to use them. recent research by jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music. only % of europeans wanted to watch video while on the move. more seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices. this year we are ready for an explosion of portable media microsoft s mike coleman told the bbc news website. we are very bullish about it. the fact that i can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer he added. the fact that europeans are far larger public transport users than americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too. there is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work. although microsoft s content distribution deals are for the us market at the moment talks were always on-going with european content suppliers to offer similar services. various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however. but that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices particularly via those which are wi-fi enabled. the possibility is open for non-professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work. ces which runs from to january showcases more than new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in .
730,eu software patent law delayed controversial new eu rules for the patenting of computer-based inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from poland. poland - a large and therefore crucial eu member - has requested more time to consider the issue especially as it relates to the patenting of software. critics say the law would favour large companies over small innovative ones. they say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software. polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software. the planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the eu should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the us. so for instance us-based amazon.com holds a patent on one-click shopping . critics claim the law which the eu says is needed to harmonise with the us is little more than a law on ideas. patent rights it is claimed protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected eva lichtenberg a austrian green member of the european parliament said in a statement. smaller innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them she added. the european parliament has already clashed with the european union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic. the directive has been subject to several previous delays.
532,england s defensive crisis grows england s defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of tottenham s ledley king from the squad to face holland. chelsea s john terry and wayne bridge are also out leaving coach sven-goran eriksson with a real problem for wednesday s match at villa park. injured rio ferdinand and sol campbell were both left out of the squad and matthew upson has already pulled out. wes brown and jamie carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership. terry the captain of chelsea as they push for the premiership title would have been a certain starter in the absence of campbell and ferdinand. but now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by carragher alongside brown. manchester united s brown last played for england in the defeat by australia at upton park in february . the -year-old was only called into the squad on sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of upson who has a hamstring injury. and brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for england. king was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by england s medical staff. eriksson has still not decided whether to call up any further back-up having already summoned phil neville after bridge pulled out with a foot injury.
1592,iran jails blogger for years an iranian weblogger has been jailed for years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries. arash sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. mr sigarchi who also edits a newspaper in northern iran was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the gilan area. his sentence criticised by human rights watchdog reporters without borders comes a day after an online day of action to secure his release. iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs restricting access to major blogging sites from within iran. a second iranian blogger motjaba saminejad who also used his website to report on bloggers arrests is still being held. a spokesman for reporters without borders which tracks press freedom across the globe described mr sigarchi s sentence as harsh and called on iranian president mohammed khatami to work to secure his immediate release. the authorities are trying to make an example of him the organisation said in a statement. by handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media. in the days before his arrest mr sigarchi gave interviews to the bbc persian service and the us-funded radio farda. iranian authorities have arrested about online journalists during the current crackdown. they accused mr sigarchi of a string of crimes against iranian state including espionage insulting the founder of iran s islamic republic ayatollah ruhollah khomenei and current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei. mr sigarchi s lawyer labelled the revolutionary court illegal and incompetent and called for a retrial in a public court. mr sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world. the committee to protect bloggers designated february as free mojtaba and arash day. around people visited the campaign s website during the day. about % of users were based in iran the campaign s director told the bbc news website. curt hopkins said mr sigarchi s sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. the eyes of million bloggers are going to be more focused on iran since sigarchi s sentence not less. the mullahs won t be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere.
627,portishead back after eight years cult british group portishead have revealed they are writing their third album their first in eight years. founding member geoff barrow told bbc music the record was well on the way to being completed. we re actually into it as we speak. we took some time off for christmas but generally we re doing another record barrow told the digital radio station. news of their album plans comes after confirmation the bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. portishead will play alongside fellow bristol band massive attack at oxfam s tsumani appeal held at the bristol academy on february. barrow said he was surprised people thought the band who won a mercury music prize in for their debut album dummy had split up. we ve just had our heads down really we ve never actually broken up or parted or whatever. so for us it just seems even though we haven t played for years we still see each other and write - we just haven t released a record for a long time. portishead will not play any new material at next month s concert which will feature singer beth gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. other acts appearing include liverpool band the coral and former led zeppelin singer robert plant. portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. dummy was a critics favourite in hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. the follow up portishead was released three years later.
865,brits debate over urban music joss stone a -year-old soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards. her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is. i m not really comfortable with the word urban. it s a word that s been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music. the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it s wrong. how far are the brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing it s so far removed that i don t expect them to get it bang on. the music industry isn t championing music from our particular genre very well anyway. people don t feel like that s anything to do with us. i don t feel like urban music s just been celebrated by [joss stone] winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that there s an urban music scene because it s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day. it s not really relevant. if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she s signed to then so be it. it s got nothing to do with what s really going on. urban as a genre is very broad. if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hip-hop r&b garage and into that obviously comes soul. joss stone is a soul artist. her first album was called the soul sessions. so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub-genres and there are offshoots of all of those. joss stone has had amazing success [in the us] given that she s a uk artist. what has really captured everybody s imagination is that here you have a -year-old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good - i think that s what s done it. the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base. i don t think joss was not a worthy winner. she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban. the fact that she s from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she s literally rural. the great thing about urban music is that there s a big range. if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think that s where you can call it urban - that s where this new sub-category or uber-category has come from. joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldn t argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions - it is coming from somewhere genuine. it has to come across as real. that s the only cut-off point we have here and that s the only way by which we judge people. what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background. music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi-cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion. if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too. race doesn t make a difference if everyone is included. out of all the awards dished out yesterday i m still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award. a type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life. she might not be urban but when did r&b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now r&b stands for rhythm and blues remember! that joss stone is rubbish is certain. if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip-hop soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stone s albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year. this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren t nominated or didn t win. i cant see why people can t just congratulate her for the talent that she is. she did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music. its a stupid phrase and particularly british. in the states they tend to use hip hop and r&b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what i m talking about. very strange. what s in a name a rose by any other name etc... if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesn t describe everything you can dance to. whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won. urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities - i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties i ve been to. good luck to joss stone let s celebrate her victory - let s also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast - we didn t see a single black artist on stage collecting an award. so what you re saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn t black. and if it is then they shouldn t be acknowledged for it even if they re pretty dam good at it she s has an amazing voice and won. good on her. oh but she s not black well let s make her feel real bad about it then. how dare she! though hang on didn t the so-called public vote on this one this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the and in relation to what jazz was. the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists. it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time. jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term. and so what of urban music in truth it s a lazy term to categorise music that you don t really understand. soul and garage are worlds apart musically (marvin gaye v tuff jam ) but no doubt have their connections. if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents. i demand a prize for rural music! sucks to the cities- it s way better out here. we have hay for one thing. excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making. if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing. (btw i m black too) how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsense. i love joss to bits and don t care what her branding is - it s amazing music full stop. stop puting it all in brackets and let s just call it music and let s especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour. surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from. joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music. if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards. the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people. this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards. it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable. the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind. the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means. perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/rnb and hip-hop one which does not also mean something else - as we have done with crunk . urban is just a word that s come about recently to describe black music that s become popular now. the word wasn t even in use or common use five of six years ago. it s just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it. i m in a band that has been called urban and i despise the label. i d hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because that s all it is. ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity. look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music. ignore the labels it is what it is just music. as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives. black people should lead the music they invented . we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless. the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc. who s ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson.. they are both times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos but why not brits so what if joss stone won the urban awards. her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white... it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else. urban is pc version for saying black music. i m not doubting ms stone s talent but why didn t jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing. refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days. more power to you people! you have said it: there is music you like and music you don t like - who cares what label you put on it that entire category was a mess. how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof. she should have been nominated for best british r & b act. joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i don t think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams. urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin well doesn t that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc. and doesn t that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it doesn t make any sense. why does music have to be put into a genre it s music you like it or you don t. simple as that. i play in a heavy metal band. we are urban music as far as i m concerned. we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; it therefore directly shapes what we write musically. urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music. why it needed a rebrand i don t know as the name is misleading. oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as they re a white rock band they won t be described as such. joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored. yeah she deserved it. she is talented. urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though. there s only two kinds of music: good and bad.
1457,iranian misses israel match iranian striker vahid hashemian will not travel to israel for bayern munich s champions league match against maccabi tel aviv on wednesday. the german club said the player had pulled out because of a back injury. iran refuses to recognise israel s right to exist and does not allow its citizens to travel to the country. a bayern spokesman said on monday that the decision not to take hashemian to israel had been motivated only by his physical condition. he s got back pain and he couldn t train the spokesman said. it would have made no sense for him to go. iran gave judo world champion arash miresmaeili a $ reward when he refused to fight an israeli at the athens olympics. the international judo federation considered taking action against miresmaeili but concluded he had been overweight for the fight and could not have taken part.
1525,tories attack eu asylum moves david blunkett has been accused of using the politics of confusion to disguise new eu immigration measures. tory spokesman david davis told mps the uk was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to britain. the eu has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states. mr blunkett told mps the uk would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with. he argued closer co-operation with europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the uk. if we don t like what other eu countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the british people he said. the home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his tory opposite number mr davis. the government is employing the politics of confusion - i think deliberately argued mr davis. by confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto. on monday tony blair insisted closer co-operation did not mean losing control of british borders. he said an enlarged -member eu needs a streamlined decision making process. mr davis said once britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out - leaving the uk open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant. he accused the government of being pathetic when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of surrendering on the issue. and he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the eu constitution which voters in the uk had been promised a referendum over. mr blair told his monthly news conference britain had the best of both worlds and would keep the veto. there is no question of britain giving up our veto on our border controls he said. with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe. mr blunkett met his eu counterparts in luxembourg on monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue. the member-states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy in favour of the qualified majority voting (qmv) system. under this scheme larger states such as britain are expected to have more power than the smaller eu states. britain is expected to retain an opt-in right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with. liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a european asylum solution. if we don t work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours said mr oaten. the liberal democrats have long argued that britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it s right that we don t do this in isolation.
2149,wi-fi web reaches farmers in peru a network of community computer centres linked by wireless technology is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in peru. the pilot scheme in the huaral valley kilometres north of the capital lima aims to offer the -strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. the agricultural information project for farmers of the chancay-huaral valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation enabling them to coordinate their actions. more than rural inhabitants as well as students in the region will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure. the telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. the network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in september. the non-government organisation cepes (peruvian centre for social studies) led the $ project also backed by local institutions the education and agriculture ministries and european development organisations. the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system said carlos saldarriaga technical coordinator at cepes. farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes. one of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system with its flagship huaral.org website. there farmers can find the prices for local produce as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancay-huaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. water is the main element that unites them all. it is a precious element in peru s coastal areas because it is so scarce and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website. the information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of peru and even around the world. cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project s success. throughout the last three years the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them said mr saldarriaga. the community training sessions attended by an equal number of men and women have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. we have had an excellent response mainly from young people. but we have also had a great feedback when we trained or -year old women who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives. so far the huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers organisations in peru. this is a pilot project and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places underlined mr saldarriaga. the cepes researcher recalls what happened in cuyo a -family community with no electricity during the construction of the local telecentre site. there it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate worth of power for the computers the communications equipment and the cabin lights. it was already dark when the technicians realised they didn t have any light bulbs to test the generator so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs recalls carlos saldarriaga. the logical answer was we don t sell any so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing. now with the wireless network cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.
1122,turkey knocks six zeros off lira turkey is to relaunch its currency on saturday knocking six zeros off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering its growing economy. the change will see the end of such dizzyingly-high denominations as five million lira - enough for a short taxi ride - and the note worth $. these valuations were the product of decades of inflation which as recently as was as high as %. inflation has since been tamed and economic prospects are improving. the currency - officially to be known as the new lira - will be launched at midnight on january. from that point the one-million lira note will become the new one-lira coin. the government hopes the change will be seen as a promise of growing economic stability as turkey embarks on the long process of trying to join the european union. on an everyday level it is hoped the change will stimulate more international trade and end confusion among foreign investors and turks alike. the transition to the new turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years said sureyya serdengecti head of the turkish central bank. the new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years. the turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs. turkey had to turn to the international monetary fund for financial assistance accepting a $ loan in return for pushing through a wide-ranging austerity programme. these tough measures have borne fruit. inflation fell below % earlier this year for the first time in decades while exports are up % this year. meanwhile the economy is expanding at a healthy rate with .% growth expected in . the government hopes that the new currency will cement the country s economic progress two weeks after eu leaders set a date for the start of turkey s accession talks. the slimmed-down lira is likely to be widely welcomed by the business community. the turkish lira has been like funny money tevfik aksoy chief turkish economist for deutsche bank told associated press. now at least in cosmetic terms it will look like real currency. however some do not feel quite so happy about seeing the nominal value of their investments reduced. if a person has billion lira in investments this will suddenly decrease shop owner hayriye evren told associated press. this will definitely affect people psychologically.

1299,troubled marsh under sec scrutiny the us stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker marsh & mclennan s shareholder transactions the firm has said. the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of % or more of the firm s shares. marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the sec investigation. marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the new york attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. since that inquiry was launched in october marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. prosecutors allege that marsh - the world s biggest insurance broker - and other us insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. this is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by new york s top law officer eliot spitzer and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the state of california. the sec s investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the trident funds managed by mmc capital the company s private equity firm. marsh s new chief executive michael cherkasky is trying to negotiate a settlement with mr spitzer. mr spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate america s misdeeds. the uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - standard & poor s moody s and fitch - to downgrade marsh in recent weeks. according to the financial times insurance analysts are now questioning whether marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year. doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind.
2106,us trade deficit widens sharply the gap between us exports and imports has widened to more than $ (£.) an all-time record. figures from the commerce department for november showed exports down .% to $. while imports grew .% to $. on rising consumer demand. part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports. but the numbers suggested the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact and could indicate slowing economic growth. the trade deficit - far bigger than the $ widely expected on wall street - prompted a rapid response from the currency markets. by gmt the dollar was trading against the euro at $. almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement. against the pound the dollar was down about .% at $ . the dollar s fall has been sudden violent and appropriate given this number said brian taylor of wells fargo in minneapolis. recent exchange rate movements certainly haven t had any impact yet. treasury secretary john snow put a brave face on the news saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion. the economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income... some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners. although the white house officially still backs the us s traditional strong dollar policy it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued. the dollar has fallen by % against the euro - as well as by % against the yen - in the past three years. the main catalyst most economists accept is the large budget deficit on the one hand and the current account deficit - the difference between the flow of money in and out of the us - on the other. the trade deficit is a large part of the latter. in november the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals as well as of cars consumer goods and food. one small bright spot for us policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with china often blamed for job losses and other economic woes. although china s overall trade surplus is expanding according to chinese government figures the commerce department revealed the us s deficit with china was $. in november down from $. the month before. but the deficit with japan was at its worst in more than four years.
1380,world leaders gather to face uncertainty more than business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum (wef). for five days they will discuss issues ranging from china s economic power to iraq s future after this sunday s elections. uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. unlike previous years protests against the wef are expected to be muted. anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. the brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum timed to run in parallel with the wef s ritzier event in davos. the organisers of the brazilian gathering which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation for fair trade and many other causes have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the swiss summit. however many of the issues discussed in porto alegre are davos talking points as well. global warming features particularly high. wef participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. davos itself is in deep frost. the snow is piled high across the mountain village and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus and less. ultimately the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world s largest companies scheduled to attend. but much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to davos not least because the agenda of this year s forum seems to lack an overarching theme. taking responsibility for tough choices is this year s official talking point hinting at a welter of knotty problems. one thing seems sure though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with iran iraq and china are set to dominate discussions. pointedly only one senior official from president bush s new administration is scheduled to attend. the us government may still make a conciliatory gesture just as happened a year ago when vice president dick cheney made a surprise appearance in davos. ukraine s new president viktor yushchenko is to speak just days after his inauguration an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power. the european union s top leaders among them german chancellor gerhard schroeder and european commission president manuel barosso will be here too. mr blair will formally open the proceedings although his speech will be pre-empted by french president jacques chirac who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a special message two hours before mr blair speaks. the organisers also hope that the new palestinian leader mahmoud abbas will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event a list that includes shimon peres. davos fans still hark back to when talks between yassir arafat and mr peres came close to a peace deal. mr blair s appearance will be keenly watched too as political observers in the uk claim it is a calculated snub against political rival chancellor gordon brown who was supposed to lead the uk government delegation. microsoft founder bill gates the world s richest man and a regular at davos will focus on campaigning for good causes though business interests will not be wholly absent either. having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against aids and malaria mr gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. on tuesday mr gates pledged $ (£) of his own money to support the cause. mr gates company software giant microsoft also hopes to use davos to shore up its defences against open source software like linux which threaten microsoft s near monopoly on computer desktops. mr gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with brazil s president lula da silva. the brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from microsoft to linux. at davos global problem solving and networking are never far apart.
1426,crisis ahead in social sciences a national body designed to tackle skills shortages in key subjects should be set up a committee of mps has said. there was an absolute crisis in the recruitment of statisticians and other social science experts the commons science and technology committee added. major problems are expected over the next years as the social science workforce continues to age it said. the committee was reporting on the work strategy and spending plans of the economic social research council. the council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country. it also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs. in its report on the council s work the committee said: we are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting in particular the qualitative branches of social sciences. this mirrored previous concerns the committee had expressed on shortages in the fields of maths and chemistry it said. it is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of economic and social research council s limited resources. if the government is serious about addressing skills shortages in key subjects it needs to find a more effective mechanism to achieve this. a national strategic capabilities fund to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response the committee added.
1098,bbc denies blackadder tv comeback the bbc has said there are no plans in the pipeline for a new series of hit comedy blackadder which ended in . tony robinson who played the servant baldrick told s this morning the show s star rowan atkinson was more keen than he has been in the past . robinson added he would love to do another series each of which was set in a different era ranging from the century to world war i. but the bbc said on thursday there were no plans for a comeback. in the final series all the main characters were killed off charging towards german lines after being ordered out of their trench. the poignant finale was later voted the best farewell episode of a tv series. a host of other uk actors including hugh laurie stephen fry and miranda richardson also appeared in the show. blackadder returned for a one-off special filmed to celebrate the arrival of the millennium in . it was shown at the millennium dome in greenwich before being screened on bskyb.
39,german growth goes into reverse germany s economy shrank .% in the last three months of upsetting hopes of a sustained recovery. the figures confounded hopes of a .% expansion in the fourth quarter in europe s biggest economy. the federal statistics office said growth for the whole of was .% after a year of contraction in down from an earlier estimate of .%. it said growth in the third quarter had been zero putting the economy at a standstill from july onward. germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean german consumers have kept their money to themselves. major companies including volkswagen daimlerchrysler and siemens have spent much of in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. according to the statistics office destatis rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand. but the relentless rise in the value of the euro last year has also hit the competitiveness of german products overseas. the effect has been to depress prospects for the -nation eurozone as a whole as well as germany. eurozone interest rates are at % but senior officials at the rate-setting european central bank are beginning to talk about the threat of inflation prompting fears that interest rates may rise. the ecb s mandate is to fight rising prices by boosting interest rates - and that could further threaten germany s hopes of recovery.
564,dawson set for new wasps contract european champions wasps are set to offer matt dawson a new deal. the -year-old world cup winning scrum-half has impressed since joining the london side from northampton this summer on a one-year contract. wasps coach warren gatland told the daily mirror: we have not yet offered matt a new contract but we will be doing so. i m very happy with his contribution and i think he s good enough to play for another couple of years. dawson played a vital part in england s world cup win last year but has fallen out of favour with new coach andy robinson after missing a training session in september. however he hopes the new deal will help him regain his england place. rugby is still my priority and there s still a burning desire within me to play the best rugby i possibly can he said. i know within myself if i was given the chance i could play for england again. i know i m fit enough i m strong enough i m skilful enough.
636,end bush denial blair tells eu tony blair is urging european leaders to wake up from their state of denial over president bush s re-election. america has spoken. the rest of the world should listen the prime minister said in an interview with the times newspaper published on friday. mr blair is at a summit in brussels where iraq and european justice and immigration plans are on the agenda. french president jacques chirac reacted to his warning by saying europe instead needed to reinforce its own unity. mr blair has probably been closer to president bush than any other european leader. he said some people were in a sort of state of denial about the us election result but predicted a more receptive mood would emerge soon. america needed to listen to the world too he said. the fact is that president bush is there for four years. he is there because the american people have chosen him he argued. he also made clear he intended to take seriously what he perceives as his role in bringing the two continents together. britain was uniquely placed to make out the common ground because of its strong alliance with the us he suggested. he admitted he had gone to bed at well before the american polls closed thinking mr kerry might have won. he woke up at to discover mr bush had won but declined to say if he was pleased with the eventual result. his words about president bush met a cool reception from jacques chirac. the french president told reporters: europe today has more than ever the need the necessity to reinforce itself and its dynamism and unity. that is the goal of the constitution in a world that is more multi-polar than ever. mr chirac will miss an address to the summit from iraqi interim leader iyad allawi who this week criticised nations which took a spectator role to iraq s reconstruction. mr chirac denied there was any snub - he is going to a memorial service for the united arab emirates late leader and says he would be happy to meet mr allawi. he also signed a communiqu& stressing the eu s commitment to securing a stable and unified iraq. the eu also confirmed a new $ aid package. the communiqu& congratulated president bush on his victory and stressed the importance of good transatlantic relations. the summit is also expected to agree changes to streamline european asylum and immigration decisions. mr blair recently said the uk would only participate in eu-wide measures where it was in uk interests but the tories say he is surrendering a key veto. the meeting will also assess progress on the economic reform plans agreed in lisbon in to make europe more competitive.

1355,smith aims to bring back respect scotland manager walter smith says he wants to restore the national team s respectability in world football. smith has joined his first squad for a three-day get-together near manchester in preference to playing a friendly. while qualification for the world cup appears to be beyond scotland smith is anxious that the remainder of the campaign should be positive. i think we have got to try to get a bit of respectability back in whatever way we can he said. we will have to approach each game differently. obviously we will have to approach the italian game away from home in a different manner to moldova at home. we have to meet the challenge of each match. smith meeting a number of his squad for the first time brought them together on monday to outline his ideas for improving the nation s fortunes. he said: i pointed out how i see the international team going forward and that was the main topic. this is a relaxed gathering and i don t think there is a lot of doom and gloom about the squad that a lot of people think exists. a -man squad will spend the next three days based at the mottram hall hotel in cheshire and will train at manchester united s nearby carrington complex. smith will be absent for the final sessions however as he is due to fly out to sardinia on wednesday to watch italy s friendly with russia.
218,new rules tackle sham weddings new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force. from tuesday most non-eu citizens will need home office approval to marry. the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages of which there are estimated to be up to a year. but immigrants group the joint council for the welfare of immigrants (jcwi) says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge. when the changes were unveiled last year immigration minister des browne said: our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages while providing firm controls to prevent abuse. under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the uk only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give days notice of the wedding at the local register office. but from tuesday all non-eu nationals apart from citizens of switzerland liechtenstein iceland or norway intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office certificate of marriage approval . to get a certificate costing £ applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the uk. those without a settled status such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application will have no right to marry in the uk. once they have the necessary documentation those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in england or wales must register their intention to marry at one of specially-designated register offices. they can however marry at the register office or church of their choice. rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were not proportionate and discriminatory . these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort. we re currently taking a legal opinion on this. we ll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we ll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court ms beynon said. the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights. in a report published last july the cross-party committee stated there was a significant risk the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were disproportionate . the committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the human rights act on the grounds of religion belief and nationality the report added. over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions. in january people who took part in a sham marriage network based in leicester were jailed for a total of years. and last november samuel amoah a belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the uk was jailed for three years. several other cases are currently going through the courts. the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office has been key in many prosecutions. registrars spokesman mark rimmer said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent. they will effectively remove most of the blatant cases. certainly those who are illegals in this country of which we had quite a few will no longer be getting married mr rimmer said. mr rimmer the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north-west london said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties. it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it s still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry for example in holland germany or france. i think it s a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem mr rimmer said.

941,cheaper chip for mobiles a mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful. the specially-designed chip developed by texas instruments could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of gaming and -frame-a-second video. currently rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. the technology omap-vox is being tested by firms in europe and asia and could appear by the end of the year. texas which makes computer chips for more than half the world s mobile phones said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable. we re going to drive them down into meat-and-potatoes phones that have the largest market share said doug rasor a marketing vice president at texas. the chip also uses much less power than conventional chips said texas which means less strain on mobile battery life. more than million people own a mobile in the uk but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. texas is keen to cash in on the third generation () of mobile technology which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions. but it faces stiff competition from the likes of intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high-end mobiles. competition to get people using mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the uk s operators have now launched third generation networks. a recent survey by sony ericsson predicted that the number of handsets sold in would double from to account for % of all phones sold. many consumers are still to be convinced though. a further recent survey said that only % of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to phones. many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard. but there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks. earlier in january ntt docomo and vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high-speed networks known as super intended to be times faster than services. the first stage of development is to be completed by but no date has been set for a commercial launch the newly-designed omap-vox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference which takes place in cannes france this week.

699,eu china arms ban to be lifted the eu embargo on arms exports to china is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite us objections uk foreign secretary jack straw has said. the -year-old ban was imposed in the aftermath of china s crackdown on protesters in tiananmen square. mr straw told a commons select committee human rights concerns over china remained. but he said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burma. in december the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. the eu s move was welcomed at the time by beijing which described the embargo as a product of the cold war . german chancellor gerhard schroeder and french president jacques chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. britain has been more cautious on the issue but on wednesday mr straw said he also wanted it to end. i have long understood china s argument that to lump them in with say burma and zimbabwe is not appropriate and i don t think it is he told the joint committee on strategic export controls. he said it is more likely than not that the ban would be lifted before britain takes over the presidency of the eu from luxembourg in july. but he said an eu code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country. if it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to china as we have now. mr straw said the us government was suspicious of the motives of some other countries within the eu in wanting the ban lifted. but he said many of washington s objections were based on a lack of information and understanding of how export control guidelines worked in eu countries. and intense discussions were taking place with us officials to convince them it was the right thing to do. washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by china to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan. us officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the eu code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses. us undersecretary of state john bolton is meeting british officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo.
1397,parties warned over grey vote political parties cannot afford to take older uk voters for granted in the coming election says age concern. a survey for the charity suggests % of over- say they always vote in a general election compared with just % of to year olds. charity boss gordon lishman said if a decisive blow was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. a total of adults aged or over were interviewed for the study. mr lishman urged the next government to boost state pension. he also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to support us all in an ageing society . older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives mr lishman said. political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote. in the survey carried out by icm research % of people aged between and said they never voted in general elections. among the over- % said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election compared with % of people under . age concern says the over- are united around key areas of policy they want the government to focus on. for % pensions and the nhs were key issues while the economy was important for a third and tax was a crucial area for %. the report was welcomed by conservative shadow pensions secretary david willetts. the pensioners voice must certainly be heard in the next election as they have never fitted into blair s cool britannia he said. labour s continued refusal to admit the true extent of the pensions crisis will be one of the monumental failures of this government. he pointed to tory plans to increase the basic state pension to reduce means testing strengthen company pensions and encourage savings. a liberal democrat spokesman said the party took the issues raised in the report very seriously. he highlighted the party s promises to raise the basic state pension provide free long-term care for the elderly and replace council tax seen as a particular problem for pensioners on fixed incomes. labour has said it wants to use savings reforms to incapacity benefit to improve the basic state pension and has set up a review of the council tax system.
1545,labour faces cold calls inquiry labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on cold calling householders. the information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the lib dems about how labour uses its call centres. the lib dems say labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls. labour denies breaking rules. it says calls are not marketing if they just ask about people s voting intentions. the party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue. telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service (tps) lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. lib dem chairman matthew taylor has written to the watchdog accusing labour of a flagrant and systematic breach of the laws governing the tps. he says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future. his letter to the commissioner quotes from a labour party handbook about identifying target voters . and it quotes a stevenage labour party members newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions. the voters are put in categories according to their last known voting intention ranging from labour (firm) to target (conservative) - those who supported the party in the past but this time will be voting tory. the newsletter says: using the information we know about people we can send them direct mailings. for example we could send the target (conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the tories to labour explaining the reasons why voting tory is a bad idea or we could send labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote. mr taylor tells the commissioner: it is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the labour party is engaging in a large-scale voter id project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings. insofar as this project is directed at tps subscribers it is equally clear that it is unlawful. the lib dems raised worries about labour and conservative calls in february and people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain. a party official said there was only scattered evidence of the tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about labour. a spokeswoman for the information commissioner s office said it was examining one complaint about political calls - understood to be mr taylor s. we are investigating one of the complaints where some evidence has been given to us she said. obviously evidence is needed for us to start investigations. the commissioner s office will now examine the lib dem evidence. the guidance is that cold calling can be made as long as no marketing is going on said the spokeswoman. if labour is judged to have broken the rules it will be asked stop immediately. if it fails to do so after two or three warning letters the commissioner can issue an enforcement notice spelling out what the party needs to do or stop doing. the party could appeal against the decision to an information tribunal. if the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules it could be fined up to £ . labour says it avoids those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making voter identification calls. asked about the commissioner s inquiry a labour spokesman told bbc news: we expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously. however we are absolutely clear that we haven t broken any rules. as the information commissioner himself has said if people are not marketing something if they are asking them which way they are going to vote they are not in breach of the law. we always ask everyone we phone up whether they would be happy to be contacted by the labour party again.
1536,further rise in uk jobless total the uk s jobless total rose for the second month in a row in december official figures show. the number of people out of work rose to . million in the last three months of even as more people were in employment. average earnings rose by .% in the year to december up from november s .% the office for national statistics (ons) added. meanwhile the benefit claimant total fell to last month. throughout the number of people in work increased by to . million - the highest figure since records began in . the apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive. while the uk s jobless rate rose to .% from .% in the previous quarter the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world compared with .% in germany .% in spain and .% in france. but despite more people being in work the manufacturing sector continued to suffer with workers axed during the last quarter of - pushing employment in the sector to a record low of . million by the end of last year. the figures prompted some analysts to forecast that the bank of england will almost certainly raise rates this year. marc ostwald a strategist at monument securities told reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected it is enough to underline that they (the boe) will be more hawkish on rates .
1533,uk rebate unjustified - chirac french president jacques chirac has called the uk s £ rebate from the european union unjustified . speaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the eu would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. earlier foreign secretary jack straw said the uk was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in . he said it remained justified because less eu farm money came to the uk. mr chirac told reporters in brussels: one can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the british cheque. it can no longer be justified. it was from the past. but a uk government official responded: even with the rebate the uk pays two and a half times more than france contributes to the eu budget. without it we would pay times as much as france. there can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate. the -member eu is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period - with the bloc s luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a june summit. earlier conservative graham brady said the rebate was a crucial test of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for britain. eu commission president jose manuel barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. mr straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the uk wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions. the uk france germany austria the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at % of member states combined national incomes - the european commission has urged an increase to .%. mr straw has said the eu commission s proposal would mean a % hike in the budget. shadow europe minister mr brady said: i believe it is essential that britain keeps the rebate and i think it s a crucial test of how firmly the british government is prepared to stand up for britain internationally in europe. the uk is already one of the biggest net contributors to the eu . the foreign secretary meanwhile said the justice of the rebate remained. we have one of the lowest net receipts of any eu country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency. that continues to be the case. uk independence party leader roger knapman said the rebate was set in stone and there was no reason to negotiate about it. it is extraordinary to do it at this time just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the eu. if we lose our rebate as well the british taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that i think everyone will go off the european project. eu leaders are holding talks in brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish european economy. uk prime minister tony blair is meeting his eu counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the european constitution. the plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. critics - including germany and france - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in eastern europe undercutting large eu economies and undermining social protections. there are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern european countries who will head west exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in germany. mr straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate. european countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods he said. what we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services. britain s low unemployment meant there was less neurosis about people coming from eastern european countries. in countries like germany and france where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in he said.
867,johnson accuses british sprinters former olympic champion michael johnson has accused britain s top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition. at the moment the biggest factor on the mind of british sprinters is to be number one in britain the world and record holder told five live. athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show a little more pride. however linford christie countered: it s easy to criticise when you haven t gone through the system here. johnson was involved in a verbal spat with britain s darren campbell earlier this year. the american had cast doubt on campbell s claims he had torn a hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the olympic and finals. and the american remains highly critical of aspects of british sprinting. the only time you see british sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other he claimed. athletes here have to compete more outside the uk. their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top british sprinter. speaking at an elite coaches conference in birmingham johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in britain it had not necessarily reaped the rewards. you can t fix everything with money he admitted. you contrast the situation here to that of some us athletes who have no funding. those who aren t funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is a lot more difficult and challenging. so when they get to the top they are more appreciative.
759,gm pays $ to evade fiat buyout general motors of the us is to pay fiat . euros ($; £.) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the italian car maker outright. fiat had sold gm a stake in as part of a partnership agreement. but fiat s heavy losses have convinced gm - whose own european operations are in the red - to back away. the pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures but fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. fiat s shares on the milan stock exchange rose .% by gmt to . euros having shot up more than % in early trading. we now have absolute freedom to design our own future said fiat chief executive sergio marchionne. analysts said fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal although some predictions had expected a euro pay-off. fiat is to get euros immediately with another to follow within days. the firm is italy s largest private employer and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the italian economy. for its part gm was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake. we needed scale in europe to get costs down and we were able to do that in working with fiat said gm chief executive rick wagoner. the fiat-gm alliance came about in as an alternative to selling fiat outright. german-us car firm daimlerchrysler had been willing to buy the firm but fiat patriarch gianni agnelli did not want to give up control. instead gm swapped a % stake in itself for % of fiat - and gave fiat a put option to sell gm the rest of the car maker between january and july . but despite the alliance fiat failed to put itself back on track continuing to lose money and market share. as a result the sell-off looked better and better for the italians - and much worse for gm which is struggling with its own loss-making european marques opel and saab. the relationship soured further after fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in halving gm s stake to %.
840,ban hits half-life pirates hard about people have been banned from playing the half-life game. game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally. copies of half-life had been circulating on file-sharing systems soon after it was officially released. experts said the success of the half-life anti-piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version. half-life was officially released on november but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online. authentication involved setting up an account with valve s gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run. in a statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies. the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain half-life read the statement. valve spokesman doug lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all steam players the represented. one effect of steam s popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game s ranking in the top ten. even so the title debuted at no in the uk charts. valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts. some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account. some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of valve s anti-piracy actions. in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half-life keys copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game just to catch pirates and cheats were false. the company said: the hack came from the community as do they all. it added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of half-life circulating on file-swapping systems such as bit torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for cd keys. rob fahey editor of online news site gamesindustry.biz said the mass banning showed off the power of the steam system. before now he said it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played. but with this valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half-life he said. if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum said mr fahey other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems. it s not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games he said. this could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written steam-type systems that are used to batter people with adverts. unless game firms were careful he said they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play.
497,putin backs state grab for yukos russia s president has defended the purchase of yukos key production unit by state-owned oil firm rosneft saying it followed free market principles. vladimir putin said it was quite within the rights of a state-owned company to ensure its interests were met. rosneft bought % of baikal finance group in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of russia s booming oil industry. rosneft will now control about % of russia s total crude oil output. yukos share jumped in moscow climbing as much as % before being suspended. rosneft is already in the process of merging with gazprom the world s biggest gas company a move that will see gazprom return to majority state-ownership. baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant yukos s main production division at a forced auction on sunday. everything was done by market methods mr putin said at his year-end press conference in moscow. shedding some light on the kremlin s motivation mr putin referred to a period of so-called cowboy capitalism that followed the collapse of the soviet union. he said privatisations carried out in the early had involved trickery including law breaking by people seeking to acquire valuable state property. now the state using market methods is safeguarding its interests. i think this is quite normal the russian president said. a rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a balanced national energy corporation. the latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed yukos one of russia s biggest companies to the brink of collapse. the russian government put yukos s yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $ (£) bill for back taxes and fines. analysts say that yukos s legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the us are probably what caused this week s cloak-and-dagger dealings. gazprom the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction. by selling the yukos unit to little-known baikal and then to rosneft russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines analysts said. you cannot sue the russian government said eric kraus a strategist at moscow s sovlink securities. the russian government has sovereign immunity. the government is renationalising yuganskneftegas. even so analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go. the rosneft announcement came just hours after yukos accused gazprom of illegally taking part in sunday s auction. it has said it will be seeking damages of $. the claim was made at the latest hearing in the us bankruptcy court in houston texas where yukos had filed for chapter bankruptcy protection. if found in contempt of the us court order blocking the auction gazprom could face having foreign assets seized. yukos lawyers had also been expected to try to have baikal s assets frozen. lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because yukos - with an office in houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of us law which has worldwide jurisdiction. further muddying the waters is a merger between rosneft and gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned.
793,doors open at biggest gadget fair thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in las vegas for the annual consumer electronics show (ces). the fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. about new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. microsoft chief bill gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation xbox. the thrust of this year s show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store listen to and watch what they want on devices any time anywhere. about people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than . million square feet. highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging storage technologies thinner flat screen and high-definition tvs wireless and portable technologies gaming and broadband technologies. the show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as intel microsoft and hewlett packard among others. the story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them jeff joseph from the consumer electronics association (cea) told the bbc news website. it is about personalisation - taking your player and creating your own playlist taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters. consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in according to figures released by ces organisers the cea on tuesday. the gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the us in . shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost % between and . that trend is predicted to continue according to cea analysts with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by % again in . the fastest-growing technologies in included blank dvd media liquid crystal display (lcd) tvs digital video recorders (dvrs) and portable music players. this year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your pvr [personal video recorder] in your living room you can move that content around the house. some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere said mr joseph. he said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the democratisation of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music video and images. there will also be more focus on the design of technologies following the lead that apple s ipod made with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern. the cea predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. gaming would continue to thrive especially on mobile devices and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. games consoles sales have been declining but the launch of next generation consoles such as microsoft s xbox and playstation could buoy up sales. although it has been widely predicted that mr gates would be showcasing the new xbox some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. some have suggested the announcement may take place at the games developers conference in the summer instead. with more than % of us homes expected to have home networks the cea suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home will be more commonplace. portable devices that combine mobile telephony digital music and video players will also be more popular in . their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films tv and audio wherever they are. this means more storage technologies will be in demand such as external hard drives and flash memory like sd cards. ces runs officially from to january.

913,police detain chinese milk bosses chinese police have detained three top executives at milk firm yili with reports suggesting that they are being investigated for embezzlement. yili - full name inner mongolia yili industrial - confirmed its chairman chief financial officer and securities representative were all in custody. the company china s third-largest milk producer is to hold an emergency meeting to debate the issue. a yili spokesman said it may now move to oust chairman zheng junhuai. the spokesman did not say why the three had been detained by the police. the official xinhua news agency said the arrest was linked to alleged embezzlement. yili has recently been the subject of intense media speculation over its financial operations. executives are suspected of wrongly using yuan ($.; £) of company funds to support a management buyout back in july . yili s shares were suspended on tuesday having fallen by % on monday. the company and its two main rivals - market leader mengniu dairy and second place bright dairy - dominate a chinese milk market that has grown by almost % over the past five years. analysts wondered if the scandal at yili - the latest to befall chinese companies this year - could be followed by further revelations of corporate wrongdoing. investors wonder if yili s scandal one of a slew to be uncovered this year isn t just the tip of the iceberg said chen huiqin an analyst at huatai securities.
239,concerns over windows atms cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses a security firm has warned. the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines. already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system. but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small. for many years the venerable ibm operating system known as os/ has been the staple software used to power many of the . cash machines in operation around the world. but ibm will end support for os/ in which is forcing banks to look for alternatives. there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research. he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data. us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways. todd thiemann spokesman for anti-virus firm trend micro said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks. mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that % of new cash machines being installed were windows based. already he said there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them. in january the slammer worm knocked out cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce. in august of the same year cash machines of two un-named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm. incidents like this happen said mr thiemann because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers. this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network. this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system he said. banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network mr thiemann told bbc news online. but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year. currently he said a cash machine has a lifetime of up to years which means that only about % of all atms get swapped for a newer model every year. windows cash machines have been around for several years he said. most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle. in theory there is a bigger threat with windows than os/ he said but i do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment. it s pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with atms he said. the many different security systems built-in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously he said. banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all he added. a spokesman for the association of payment and clearing services (apacs) which represents the uk s payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal. there s no concern that there s going to be any type of virus hitting the uk networks he said. risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were a much smaller and tightly-knit community than in the us where viruses have struck.
2105,profile: david blunkett before he resigned the position of home secretary on wednesday david blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race policing and immigration. his responsibilities in running the home office included civil emergencies security terrorism and expenditure. named home secretary after the general election mr blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify. the attacks on the world trade center on september heightened concern for security and immigration in particular. a labour loyalist from a working class background mr blunkett had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to labour policy. recently the issue of identity cards had provoked controversy with questions raised over cost and invasions of civil liberties. mr blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister beverly hughes. having received his full backing ms hughes was forced to resign in april over abuses in the visa processing system which she claimed to be unaware of. mr blunkett s own comments on immigration had prompted censure - he told refugees from afghanistan and kosovo to get back home to start rebuilding their countries. and he also urged people from ethnic minorities to develop a sense of belonging in britain telling them to speak english at home. avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary who spurns a metropolitan elite and airy fairy libertarians and earlier in the year coined the phrase liberati as an amalgam of glitterati and liberal . yet in january of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis from a grade b to grade c status drug . before the recent furore mr blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life. mr blunkett told the daily telegraph in that he continued to wear his wedding ring in spite of being a divorcee as a useful way of ensuring that people don t casually think i am available . he added: i am not available because i am just getting on with the job. mr blunkett entered parliament for sheffield brightside in after first contesting the sheffield hallam seat in . he is one of very few blind mps and was the first to reach the front bench and the cabinet. his relaxed performances - with his guide dog by his side - at the despatch box in the labour party s national executive and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability. mr blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply an inconvenience . using braille for speeches and briefed by his officials on tape he also has a sharp tongue at times and a pragmatic approach to politics. mr blunkett was schooled in sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the commons. he chaired the labour party nationally and was a unifying force in the and shadowing health and education. in tony blair s first government mr blunkett was put in charge of education and employment where he won big increases in funds for schools while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy. he was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions - which sometimes heckled his speeches - and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular. in the labour party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague a conciliator who avoids factions and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. there have been wry smiles as well. in his then guide dog lucy threw up in the chamber during the speech of his tory opponent. lucy was replaced by her half-sister sadie a black labrador-curly-coated retriever cross in after nearly a decade by mr blunkett s side.
181,blogger grounded by her airline a us airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog or online diary. queen of the sky otherwise known as ellen simonetti evolved into an anonymous semi-fictional account of life in the sky. but after she posted pictures of herself in uniform delta airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay. ms simonetti was told her suspension was a result of inappropriate images. delta airlines declined to comment. i was really shocked i had no warning ms simonetti told bbc news online. i never thought i would get in trouble because of the blog. i thought if they had a problem someone would have said something before taking action. the issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest employment law and free speech on personal websites. ms simonetti was suspended on september pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the us equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc). a spokesperson for delta airlines told bbc news online: all i can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media. she added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past. ms simonetti started her personal blog in january to help her get over her mother s death. she had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for and created fictional names for cities and companies. the airline s name was changed to anonymous airline and the city in which she was based was called quirksville. a large part of the blog contained fictional stories because queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right according to ms simonetti. the images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother. we often take pictures on flight or on layovers. i just though why not include them on my blog for fun. i never meant it as something to harm my company and don t understand how they think it did harm them ms simonetti said. she has also claimed that pictures of male delta airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web. of the or so images on the site only one showed ms simonetti s flight wings . they did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with. i am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up she said. the images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended. as far as ms simonetti knows there is no company anti-blogging policy. there is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear. jeffrey matsuura director of the law and technology programme at the university of dayton said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees. there are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers he said. it was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly was reasonable and enforced fairly in company policy. you have to remember that as an employee you don t have total free speech anymore he said. mr matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog. one of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them but they may not be particularly clear when they [employees] do cross the line. he speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of ms simonetti in uniform were posted. whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line he said. ms simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs. one of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken. if they had asked me just take down the blog i would have done it but that was not been given to me as an option she said. this blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it. if i had known it would cost me my job i would not have done that.
165,economy strong in election year uk businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises according to a report. optimism is at its highest since and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending say researchers at bdo stoy hayward. the bank of england is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in may. the bdo optimism index - a leading indicator of gdp growth two quarters ahead edged up in january to . from . in october. the rise is due in part to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity. the only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election bdo said. its bdo s output index - which predicts gdp movements a quarter in advance - remained at . for january implying gdp growth at .% in the second quarter of . however the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises sterling s strength against the dollar and high oil prices the group noted. its inflation index which has risen continuously over the last months climbed to . in january from . in october last year. the uk is looking strong going into the general election but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the bank of england reacts to growth and inflationary pressures said peter hemington partner at bdo stoy hayward. growth will probably slow by the end of and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.
808,microsoft sets sights on spyware windows users could soon be paying microsoft to keep pcs free of spyware. following the takeover of anti-spyware firm giant microsoft said it would soon release a toolkit that strips machines of the irritating programs. although initially free microsoft has not ruled out charging people who want to keep this toolkit up to date. surveys show that almost every windows pc is infested with spyware programs that do everything from bombard users with adverts to steal login data. microsoft said that a beta version of the toolkit to clean up windows machines should be available within days. designed for pcs running windows and xp the utility will clean out spyware programs constantly monitor what happens on a pc and will be regularly updated to catch the latest variants. before now many of microsoft s other security boosting programs such as the firewall in windows xp have been given away free. but mike nash vice president in microsoft s security business unit said it was still working out pricing and licensing issues. charging for future versions has not been discounted he said. we ll come up with a plan and roll that out he said. the plan could turn out to be a lucrative one for microsoft. a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that % of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that on average each one is harbouring separate spyware programs. currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and ad-aware. spyware comes in many forms and at its most benign exploits lazy browsing habits to install itself and subject users to unwanted adverts. other forms hijack net browser settings to force people to view pages they would otherwise never visit. at its most malign spyware watches everything that people do with their pc and steals login information and other personal data. microsoft s announcement about spyware comes after it bought small new york software firm giant company software. terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
46,jamieson issues warning to bigots scotland s justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them where it hurts most by banning them from matches. cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. she praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. however the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. the sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue. they plan to hold an anti-sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs church leaders senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited. speaking on bbc radio scotland s sunday live programme ms jamieson described friday s meeting as very productive and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim. ms jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but it can act as a trigger for tensions and violence. clubs have taken action in the past to ban troublesome fans and supporters groups expressed their desire to ensure that the game is no longer tainted by the problem. ms jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers. she said: we can t get away from the fact that in some instances some of the religious hatred that some people try to associate with football boils over into violence. that is the kind of thing we want to stop and that s the kind of thing supporters groups are very clear they don t want to be part of either and they will work with us to try and deal with that. ms jamieson praised the police for their action and said: the police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them. we have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches to be able to stop them attending the games. that s the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games she said. praising celtic and rangers for their efforts she said: i don t think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs. both rangers and celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce for example an educational pack for young people.
1433,when technology gets personal in whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass& by then phones will be printed directly on to wrists or other parts of the body says ian pearson bt s resident futurologist. it s all part of what s known as a pervasive ambient world where chips are everywhere . mr pearson does not have a crystal ball. his job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now to guide industries into the future. inanimate objects will start to interact with us: we will be surrounded - on streets in homes in appliances on our bodies and possibly in our heads - by things that think . forget local area networks - these will be body area networks. ideas about just how smart small or even invisible technology will get are always floating around. images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology. but now a new vision is surfacing where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality form or aesthetics. such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed. so players - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into one s clothing says mr pearson. so the gadgets that fill up your handbag when we integrate those into fabric we can actually get rid of all that stuff. you won t necessarily see the electronics. wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up while video tattoos or intelligent electronic contact lenses might function as tv screens for those on the move. however this future of highly personal devices where technology is worn or even fuses with the body itself raises ethical questions. if technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing jewellery and skin there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans says baroness susan greenfield. at a recent conference for technology engineering academic and fashion industry experts at the royal society in london neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned we can t just sleepwalk into the future . yet this technology is already upon us. researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing. jackets based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves have already appeared in shops. these smart fabrics have come about through advances in nano- and micro-engineering - the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale. at the nanoscale materials can be tuned to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster lighter stronger and more efficient devices and systems. the textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways. many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine defence healthcare sports and communications. professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin. nanoscale titanium dioxide () coatings give fabrics antibacterial and anti-odour properties. these have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or uv light. such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance to turn airline seats into super stain-resistant surfaces and applied to windows so they clean themselves. dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin. but baroness greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being. if our clothing skin and personal body networks do the talking and the monitoring everywhere we go we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy. mr pearson picks up the theme pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become cyborgian . his main concern is privacy . we are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don t want every passer-by to know. so we have to make sure we build security in this. if you are wearing smart make-up where electronics are controlling the appearance you don t want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead. as technology infiltrates our biology how will our brains function differently we cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this warns baroness greenfield. there have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards. this paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers. clearly the organic carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging. the cyborg - a very familiar part-human part-inorganic science fiction and academic idea - is on its way.

1141,mandelson warns bbc on campbell the bbc should steer away from demonising ex-downing street media chief alastair campbell peter mandelson has said. the european commissioner and former labour minister was speaking amid claims that mr campbell is part of a labour dirty tricks campaign. that charge was denied by mr mandelson who said the tories were afraid of mr campbell s campaigning skills. he warned the bbc that attacking mr campbell had brought it trouble before. that was a reference to the hutton inquiry following a bbc story claiming downing street sexed up iraq s weapons of mass destruction dossier. the affair prompted the resignation of bbc chairman gavyn davies director-general greg dyke and reporter andrew gilligan. labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about tory leader michael howard s past. mr mandelson a former labour communications director told bbc radio s today programme: i understand why the tories will be gunning for alastair campbell because they fear his campaigning skills. what i understand less is why the bbc should be joining with the tories in driving that agenda. in my experience of these things parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy. i suggest the bbc concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics the trivialisation of the campaign. i think the bbc would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone concentrate on the issues as i say not resume their demonisation of alastair campbell - we all know where that led before. mr campbell is acting as an adviser for labour which denies engaging in personal campaigning. conservative co-chairman liam fox said mr campbell s return and labour poster plans attacking mr howard - recently withdrawn from the party s website - were a sign of abusive politics . the government despite the fact that they would say want to go forward not back seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly about the future he said on sunday. labour peer baroness kennedy who is chairing the power inquiry into political disengagement said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks. this feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might she said.

1291,man utd stroll to cup win wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarter-finals. rooney received a hostile reception but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park. fortune headed home after minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes free-kick. marcus bent missed everton s best chance when roy carroll who was later struck by a missile saved at his feet. rooney s return was always going to be a potential flashpoint and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. and rooney s every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the -year-old. everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goal-line. but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up. fortune gave united the lead after minutes rising to meet ronaldo s cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith. united dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent played onside by gabriel heintze hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save. united almost doubled their lead after minutes when ronaldo s low drive from yards took a deflection off tony hibbert but martyn dived to save brilliantly. and martyn came to everton s rescue three minutes later when rooney s big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after minutes as they doubled their advantage. scholes free-kick took a deflection and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo who reacted first to score easily. everton s problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury. and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. rooney s desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injury-time when he outpaced stubbs but once again martyn denied the england striker. - manchester united coach sir alex ferguson: it was a fantastic performance by us. in fairness i think everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out. the boy ronaldo is a fantastic player. he s persistent and never gives in. i don t know how many fouls he had he gets up and wants the ball again he s truly a fabulous player. everton: martyn hibbert yobo stubbs naysmith osman carsley arteta kilbane mcfadden bent. subs: wright pistone weir plessis vaughan. manchester united: carroll gary neville brown ferdinand heinze ronaldo phil neville keane scholes fortune rooney. subs: howard giggs smith miller spector. referee: r styles (hampshire)
1090,smart search lets art fans browse if you don t know art but know what you like new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting. artgarden developed by bt s research unit is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings. rather than search by the name of an artist or painting users are shown a selection of pictures. clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works. the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. it chooses a selection of pictures by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them. so for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement century and water. a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user based partly on the keywords and partly on luck. it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery said jemima rellie head of the tate s digital programme. for richard tateson who worked on the artgarden project the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration. i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i didn t have a clue what i wanted he said. the text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer neither of which he found helpful. he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead. he thinks the dominance of text-based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers. similarly with art browsing is often more important than finding a particular object. you don t arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see. one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn t have asked for he said. the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that said ms rellie. she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future. bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching such as for music and films.
1830,tough rules for ringtone sellers firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks. the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones. in the last couple of years ringtones wallpapers screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers said jeremy flynn head of third party services at vodafone. if you are not on the operator s portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it s a problem of how people discover your services he said. to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them for instance several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of . websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently said mr flynn. people did not know they were being offered a subscription service. we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here he added. the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk s phone firms. everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct said andrew bud regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox. it s all about transparency he said. consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it. the consumer has a right to be protected he said. christian harris partnership manager of mobile content firm zed said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that s done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out he said. the new rules came in to force on january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for said mr flynn. also said mr flynn vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. we have quite draconian contracts with firms he said. we do not have to say why. we can just cut them off. under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal stop command sent via text message. he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality said mr flynn.

698,britain boosted by holmes double athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals. kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games. holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over team gb after their biggest medal hope paula radcliffe dropped out of the marathon and then the . britain s men s relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. holmes had started the year in disappointing style falling over in the final of at the world indoor championships where she was favourite. her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the - her first global title. just five days later the -year-old made it double gold in the . it was the first time in years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double. while holmes left athens as the star of team gb it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games. the -year-old marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after miles in tears. her decision to enter the five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining. but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in november s new york marathon. the team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the british men s olympic squad after a poor start to the games. it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the . but darren campell jason gardener marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis made amends in the sprint relay. the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britain s first relay medal since in . seconds. gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over and just like holmes finally lived up to his promise in . kelly sotherton completed team gb s athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. the -year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in . but it was a different story for britain s defending champion denise lewis who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. lewis who was troubled by injury has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success. the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. the battling -year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze. and backley s departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete dean macey who came fourth in athens. the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb. sadly the olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. on the eve of the games greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash. kenteris the champion in and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial. at the games adrian annus (hammer) robert fazelas (discus) and irina korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol. the fallout from the thg scandal which rocked the sport in continued to impact in olympic year. britain s team took gold without the services of dwain chambers who was handed a two-year ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg. american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world and titles after failing a drugs test. and world champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence. russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles. her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events. morocco s hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the and . and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles. rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.
1360,call centre users lose patience customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up a survey suggests. once past the welcome message callers on average hang up after just seconds of listening to canned music. the drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of % every year. customers are getting used to the idea of an always available society says cara diemont of it firm dimension data which commissioned the survey. however call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls she says from just over % in to a record .% during last year. when automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. one possible reason for the lack in patience ms diemont says is the fact that more customers are calling on the move using their mobile phones. the surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres growing range of tasks. once a call centre may have looked after mortgages now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards insurance and current accounts ms diemont says. problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training the survey found. in what dimension data calls an alarming development the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from to just days leaving agents not equipped to deal with customers . this ms diemont warns is scary and not good for the bottom line either. poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. as a result call centres have a high churn rate with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just %. when the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about % but that is still well below the industry target of an % resolution rate. suggestions that outsourcing - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like india or south africa - is to blame are wrong ms diemont says. there are no big differences in wait time and call resolution between call centres based in europe or north america and those in developing countries around the world. you can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place she says. however companies that decide to offshore their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. only % of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. but not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. they give three key reasons for not making the move: - call centre operations are part of their business core function - they are worried about the risk of going abroad - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. the survey was conducted by sunovate on behalf of dimension data and is based on in-depth questionnaires of call centres in countries and five continents. what are your experiences with call centres are you happy to listen to vivaldi or greensleeves or do you want an immediate response and if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job
764,blunkett tells of love and pain david blunkett has spoken of his love for married publisher kimberly quinn for the first time. the home secretary described how it affected his friends and personal life but said he was a great believer in personal responsibility. mr blunkett is taking legal action to gain access to mrs quinn s two-year-old son. she denies he is mr blunkett s. the interview with bbc radio sheffield was made before allegations he fast-tracked a visa for mrs quinn s nanny. the allegations which he has denied are being investigated by sir alan budd. mr blunkett talked about how he fell in love - but that she resisted his desire to go public. in an apparent reference to his court action to gain access to her son he says he was a great believer in responsibility and consequences even when they were painful. mr blunkett told bbc radio sheffield: i fell in love with someone and they wouldn t go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer and then the news of the world picked up the story. i tried for three years to make something work. i haven t spoken about it and i don t intend to. even in the biography that s being written about me i ve ensured that there s as little as possible. bbc political correspondent carole walker said the timing of the broadcast was unlikely to help his efforts to show that he is concentrating on getting on with the job of home secretary. shadow home secretary david davis says mr blunkett should quit if he is found to have influenced the visa process even indirectly. reports have claimed mr blunkett chaired a meeting to discuss delays in the visa system after he learned of nanny leoncia casalme s wait. the home office has said it would be up to sir alan s inquiry to decide if any such meeting was relevant. home office minister fiona mactaggart said she hoped mr blunkett would survive in his job. i work with him every day and i have always been surprised by how focused he is on the job in hand on working to deal with things she said. she told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme: he is just really down for the job and i hope he does (survive).
2136,fido to be taken off vote lists the risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote the uk elections watchdog has said. those are some of the mistakes found under the current system where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants. the electoral commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. voters need to register by march if the next poll is on may as expected. but any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in britain before that general election. the proposed scheme would mean voters using individual identifiers when they vote - such as their own voting number date of birth and signature. the electoral commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when northern ireland switched to a similar system. there have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll the mps heard. and some people have registered all their family regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. non-british citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases. mr younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. he argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at hard to reach voters for example. some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out. mr younger said using the royal mail s postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about voters. he argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting. there have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. he said it might also help register students in halls of residences where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. the mps on the office of the deputy prime minister and constitutional affairs select committees pressed mr younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. he said the northern ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted. currently british voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. mr younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.
541,mumbai bombs movie postponed the release of a film about the mumbai (bombay) blasts in has been postponed following protests by those on trial for the bombings. investigating the blasts which killed more than people and wounded the film black friday had been due to open across india on friday. but people accused in connection with the blasts said it should not be screened until the trial is over. mumbai high court postponed the film s launch until february. black friday is based upon the novel of the same name written by journalist s hussain zaidi which looks at the explosions which rocked mumbai on march . director anurag kashyap said the film s release should not be delayed as the book has already been on sale for two years. if you have not gone against the book then how can you go against the movie mr kashyap s lawyer mihir desai said. this is the second time that those accused in connection with the blasts have sought legal intervention regarding the film. they previously asked that a line from the movie s poster which claimed the film portrayed the true story of the bombay bomb blasts be removed. their lawyer majeed memon said: we had argued that how can a film say it is telling the true story when the court itself is struggling to find the truth so we said they should remove the line from their promotional posters and they did give us an assurance that they would do so. the mumbai bombings case is one of india s longest-running trials. a special court was set up to hear the case and regular hearings have taken place there for the last nine years with more than six hundred witnesses questioned.
1645,verdict delay for greek sprinters greek athletics governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters costas kenteris and katerina thanou for missing doping tests. the pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests including one on the eve of last year s athens olympics. they were set to learn their fate by the end of february but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. a decision is now expected by around mid-march said one of their lawyers michalis dimitrakopoulos. kenteris who won the men s title at the sydney games and thanou who won the women s silver medal in sydney face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. the athletes who spectacularly withdrew from the athens olympics have been suspended by the international association of athletics federations (iaaf) for missing the three tests. the iaaf said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and ordered greek athletic s governing body segas to hold a disciplinary inquiry. the athletes also face a criminal hearing in greece over the missed drugs tests and have been charged with faking a motorcycle accident on the day of the athens test which led to them spending four days in hospital. following the final hearing in late january the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted. i am confident and optimistic thanou had said at the time. we presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of. it was not clear what this new evidence was.
1838,minimum rate for foster parents foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs the government has announced. payment levels vary from area to area with some carers getting just £ a week for clothes food and other costs. minister for children young people and families margaret hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers allowances would be as fair as possible. however local authorities which set and pay the allowances are concerned about how the extra cash will be found. about children live with foster families in the uk and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet. ms hodge said: foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society. we need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible. our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity. the government is seeking to amend the children bill which passes through the commons next week to establish a national minimum payment. fostering network executive director robert tapsfield criticised the existing system. there is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live. and with a shortage of over foster carers in england it s not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets. the charity recommends a weekly payment of £. for looking after a baby. in a survey it discovered that rates paid by neighbouring authorities could vary by as much as £ per week. the association of directors of social services (adss) said it agreed in principle with the government s plans. tony hunter the organisation s president said: there are many devils and lots of details hidden within the government s proposals. but adss fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges.

1288,howard unveils election platform the conservatives would stand up for the forgotten majority michael howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the tory election manifesto. the tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by tony blair and who share tory values. in the foreword to the manifesto he promises to focus on restoring order trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. labour says the document offers only a return to a failed tory past . the liberal democrats say the conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest. campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election which is widely tipped for may but could be any time before june . labour on monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the asian tsunami disaster. mr howard published the introduction to the tory manifesto. other chapters will follow in coming weeks. in a speech in northamptonshire he said the forgotten majority made up the backbone of britain. they were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement working hard and accepting their responsibilities. he says in the manifesto foreword: they have been forgotten neglected and taken for granted by mr blair. saying britain must change direction mr howard argues government is too big and cannot continue down the path of ever rising taxes . he promises to ensure frontline professionals parents and patients make the key decisions rather than whitehall bureaucrats . and he says the tories would get a grip on crime immigration and disorder. the decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called human rights have left us in a moral quagmire unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder he says. mr howard says he will produce a timetable for action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options not specific plans. mr howard told bbc news: i m determined to lower taxes but i m also determined not to make any promises i can t keep. the tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies he said. he was asked if tory support for the government on iraq and identity cards had given the lib dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to labour. mr howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for britain. it had nothing to do with putting clear blue water between himself and his opponents. labour s election slogan will be: britain s working don t let the tories wreck it again . campaign coordinator alan milburn accused the tories of launching thatcherism in instalments while labour helped the hard working majority of families. lib dem president simon hughes said his party had set out its election stance in september. the liberal democrats will ask the british people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust he said.

118,chelsea denied by james heroics a brave defensive display led by keeper david james helped manchester city hold the leaders chelsea. after a quiet opening james denied damien duff jiri jarosik and mateja kezman while paul bosvelt cleared william gallas header off the line. robbie fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide. chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but james kept out frank lampard s free-kick and superbly tipped the same player s volley wide. city went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat chelsea this season. and there was little to alarm them in the first minutes as chelsea - deprived of arjen robben and didier drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat. indeed it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. shaun wright-phillips - watched by england boss sven-goran eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball which was blocked by john terry. but chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. first duff got round ben thatcher and blasted in a shot that james parried to kezman who turned the ball wide. soon afterwards jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head lampard s corner goalwards but james tipped the ball over. chelsea were now looking more like premiership leaders and james kept out kezman s fierce drive before bosvelt and james combined to clear gallas header from duff s corner. city broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in fowler celebrating his premiership goal. wright-phillips raced down the left and crossed to fowler but city s lone man up front left free by terry s slip contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain. the second half started as quietly as the first although james was forced to divert a cross from the lively duff away from eidur gudjohnsen s path. there was a nasty moment for petr cech looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league when a series of ricochets saw fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the czech republic stopper. another quiet spell followed which duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by bosvelt. lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and james somehow blocked it with his legs. another timely challenge this time from richard dunne in time added on prevented gudjohnsen from getting in a shot. there was still time for james to produce a sensational save to tip lampard s volley round the post. cech paulo ferreira gallas terry bridge jarosik (tiago ) lampard makelele duff gudjohnsen kezman (cole ). subs not used: johnson smertin cudicini. makelele gudjohnsen. james mills distin dunne thatcher shaun wright-phillips bosvelt barton sibierski (mcmanaman ) musampa fowler. subs not used: macken weaver onuoha jordan. bosvelt. h webb (s yorkshire).
792,fast moving phone viruses appear security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs. the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. the cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the symbian series phone operating system. despite the warnings there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir. the original cabir worm came to light in mid-june when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. a mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time. however the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. users can protect themselves by altering a setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices. finnish security firm f-secure issued a warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone s battery. anti-virus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by a brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. so far seven versions of cabir are know to exist one of which was inside the malicious skulls program that was found in late november. symbian s series software is licenced by nokia lg electronics lenovo panasonic samsung sendo and siemens.

1111,eu referendum question unveiled the question to be asked in the referendum on the eu constitution has been unveiled by the government. it will be: should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote in the referendum expected in . critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged -state eu. if we reject this treaty britain will be isolated and weak in europe said foreign secretary jack straw who along with the rest of the cabinet will back a yes vote. patriots by definition wanted the uk to be prosperous at home and strong and influential abroad mr straw said. our role as a leading member of the eu is a crucial part of securing that. conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question seems straightforward . but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution when they should be treated as two separate issues . despite this underhand trick the referendum bill stood no chance of becoming law before the election he added. this is tony blair s cheap gesture to the pro-constitution lobby while he runs scared of a debate on europe he knows he cannot win. neil o brien director of anti-constitution group vote no said: the reality is that the government doesn t want to discuss the eu constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business. the uk independence party said: if the government believes that a no vote would mean that we should leave the european union they should just ask us if we want to leave the eu. then we can be out of it and better off much sooner. liberal democrat leader charles kennedy who backs the constitution said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year. he told bbc radio s today programme: the sooner we get on with this the better. he said the question sounded very neutral and balanced adding it would enable the argument to be enjoined fairly and squarely on both sides . green mep caroline lucas welcomed tony blair s courage in keeping his word on holding a referendum. but she added: this treaty is a flawed document that will make the eu less accountable less sustainable and less just. mr blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in rome in november but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum. that promise came after sustained pressure from opposition parties. jack straw who argues the constitution reflected a british vision for europe and gives national governments a stronger grip has said the referendum could be held in spring . but in an interview with the financial times mr blair refused to be pinned down to that date saying britain would hold a poll some time in but when i don t know . the paper said the prime minister claimed ignorance of when other countries were planning to hold their referendums.

892,rangers seal old firm win goals from gregory vignal and nacho novo gave rangers a scrappy victory at celtic park that moves them three points clear of the champions. rangers had rarely threatened until celtic goalkeeper rab douglas let defender vignal s -yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net. opposite number ronald waterreus had been rangers hero saving superbly from craig bellamy and john hartson. striker novo secured victory lobbing douglas with eight minutes remaining. it ended celtic s -game unbeaten run at home in old firm derbies and gave rangers manager alex mcleish his first victory at the home of his glasgow rivals. celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch including twice already this season. they started confidently with new signing bellamy on loan from newcastle united given his celtic debut up front with wales international colleague john hartson and chris sutton dropping into midfield. it took bellamy just four minutes to threaten taking on marvin andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by waterreus at the second attempt. he had an even better chance after hartson dispossesed sotiris kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat. but waterreus did well to beat away bellamy s disappointing low drive from yards. waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to hartson just inside the box and the dutch goalkeeper made a brave block. it was an old firm return for barry ferguson as mcleish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past hibernian. but rangers found celtic harder to break down and douglas was not threatened until minutes after the break. dado prso turned inside neil lennon only for the celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful -yard drive. a great defensive header by andrews prevented hartson pouncing from five yards out. hartson foxed vignal at the edge of the rangers box but the striker s shot on the turn was again beaten away by waterreus. rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and vignal collecting a knock back from fernando ricksen broke the deadlock douglas somehow letting the frenchman s dipping drive slip through his grasp. novo pounced on a moments hesitation in the celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing douglas. ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin but it could not prevent rangers celebrations at the final whistle. : douglas mcnamara balde varga laursen petrov lennon sutton thompson bellamy hartson. subs: marshall henchoz juninho paulista lambert maloney wallace mcgeady. : waterreus hutton kyrgiakos andrews ball buffel ferguson ricksen vignal prso novo. subs: mcgregor namouchi burke alex rae malcolm thompson lovenkrands. : m mccurry

883,brown in appeal for labour unity gordon brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed mr blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election. the chancellor would not comment on the reports but insisted he would not be diverted or distracted from tackling the challenges faced by the country. his only motivation was to ensure labour was re-elected he insisted. mr blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for gordon brown as old news. according to a new book brown s britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june . in an interview with bbc one s breakfast with frost mr blair said: i ve dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don t do deals over jobs like this - you don t. what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country. in a separate interview with bbc political editor andrew marr mr brown said: it s very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government. i think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that i have. that is my purpose in politics and that is what every day i seek to do. and i am not going to be diverted or distracted nor is tony blair by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip. the only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country. mr brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do. but mr peston said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other and that mr blair had decided in november he would quit because he felt he had lost voters trust because of the iraq war. he then changed his mind in june following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him according to the book. andrew marr said: this is enormously damaging. gordon brown knows it as well as tony blair. i think the relationship is genuinely privately very poor indeed. things are very difficult. he added: lots of ministers believe tony blair will attempt to move gordon brown out of the treasury after the election. that depends on whether there s still a labour government and their majority. senior mps are expected to raise concerns about the latest reports of infighting at the regular meeting of labour backbenchers on monday. health secretary john reid said those fuelling such reports were damaging labour s re-election chances and would not be easily forgiven. fresh speculation of a rift recently followed mr blair and mr brown s separate responses to the asian tsunami. these rumours were fuelled by mr blair s decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new marshall plan for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster. but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a load of nonsense . tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of squabbling like schoolboys . liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was getting in the way of good government .

1466,france set for new da vinci novel french booksellers are braced for a rush of interest after another book from the author of the da vinci code is translated into french. angels and demons by us author dan brown will go on sale on wednesday. the da vinci code is set in paris - including the louvre - and has sold around one million copies in france. the main character robert langdon also appears in angels and demons. the da vinci code is being made into a film starring tom hanks. angels and demons was written before the da vinci code which has sold more than million copies worldwide and been translated into more than languages since it was released in . angels and demons is set mainly in rome as symbologist robert langdon follows a -year-old trail to try to uncover a plot by an ancient brotherhood the illuminati to blow up the vatican. the novel deals with moral issues such as the debate between science and religion and also seeks to uncover some of the mysteries surrounding the pope. on his website brown wrote: i think the reason angels and demons is raising eyebrows right now is that it opens some vatican closets most people don t even know exist. but i think most people understand that an organisation as old and powerful as the vatican could not possibly have risen to power without acquiring a few skeletons in their closets. such is the success of the da vinci code in france special tours have been organised to trace langdon s footsteps including the the louvre museum and the saint sulpice church. the louvre has also given permission for parts of the film version to be shot in the museum. the film to be directed by a beautiful mind s ron howard is due to start filming at the paris museum in may and stars hanks alongside french actress audrey tautou.
1498,man city - man utd manchester united reduced chelsea s premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city. wayne rooney met gary neville s cross to the near post with a low shot which went in via a deflection off richard dunne to put united ahead. seven minutes later the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james head and into his own net. steve mcmanaman wasted city s best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. in the opening minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar. and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern. only shaun wright-phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems. wes brown also found wright-phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline. wright-phillips sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pin-point centre to the feet of mcmanaman. but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by side-footing the easy chance wide. john o shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him. he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much-needed pace into the united attack. rooney was being well marshalled by dunne - but that was all about to change. after the break united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play. and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of city s best first-half chance rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it - even if he needed the help of dunne s leg. worse was to come for dunne who had been having a fine match. on minutes he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney s cross and united seemed home and dry. however city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range. and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa. but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post. - manchester city boss kevin keegan: we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial. we started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much. but we still had four good chances two after we d gone - down the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from. - manchester united boss sir alex ferguson: it wasn t our best performance of the last three months but i think we re deserved winners. at times especially in the first half we didn t play with enough speed. but with (cristiano) ronaldo and (ryan) giggs on the speed improved. derby games can be like that they can be scrappy dull horrible and it was maybe like that. man city: james mills (bradley wright-phillips ) dunne distin thatcher shaun wright-phillips barton (macken ) sibierski mcmanaman musampa fowler. subs not used: weaver onuoha flood. booked: fowler sibierski. man utd: carroll gary neville ferdinand brown heinze o shea (ronaldo ) keane fortune fletcher (giggs ) rooney scholes (phil neville ). subs not used: howard bellion. booked: rooney scholes keane. goals: rooney dunne og. att: ref: s bennett (kent).
1167,movie body targets children s pcs the body that represents the us movie industry has released its latest tool in its campaign to clamp down on movie file-sharing aimed at parents. the movie association for america s (mpaa) free parent file scan software lets parents check their children s computers for peer-to-peer programs. it will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive. parents then have the choice to remove programs and files. the mpaa said files found would not be passed on to it. our ultimate goal is to help consumers locate the resources and information they need to make appropriate decisions about using and trading illegal files said dan glickman mpaa chief. many parents are concerned about what their children have downloaded and where they ve downloaded it from. but some computer users who had tested the latest software reported on some technology sites that the program had identified windows default wav files as copyrighted material and wanted to delete them. movie piracy cost the industry £. ($) in according to analysts. the mpaa said in a statement that it would continue to provide easy access to similar tools in the coming months to combat the deleterious effects of peer-to-peer software including such common problems as viruses trojan horses and identity theft . mr glickman said that the film industry was embracing digital age technologies like movielink and cinemanow which are legal movie sites. but legal services such as these need a chance to grow and thrive without having to compete against illegitimate operations that depend on stolen property to survive he added. the industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movie-swappers across the us but did not say how many were being sued. its first set of lawsuits were filed in november . it also started a campaign against operators of bittorrent edonkey and directconnect peer-to-peer networks. the first convictions for peer-to-peer piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software.
1437,police chief backs drinking move a chief constable has backed the introduction of -drinking saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change. however norfolk police chief andy hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed. i don t subscribe to the views of some of my colleagues who are coming out and objecting to it he said. his comments come after the liberal democrats backed tory demands that the government s plans be put on hold. andy hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans which come into force on february. i feel that is a premature position to be taking he said. among those who have criticised the plans are the uk s top policeman sir john stevens. the metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for -hour drinking should be re-examined because of a binge drinking epidemic . however mr hayman said: it would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say i m very sorry . he said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation. my view is that i have got a responsibility to create an environment where that can happen he said. however he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for -hour drinking. but he is confident problems in the early days can be ironed out . he believed the majority of people favoured this law change and we have to accept that lifestyles are changing . but aspects such as transport and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account. prime minister tony blair has defended the licensing act saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in europe because of a tiny minority of violent binge drinkers. a six-month transitional period starts on february during which time venues can apply for extended licences. the conservatives have called for -hour drinking to be shelved until the problems of binge drinking are solved. on monday the lib dems also called for a delay. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: it would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours. chief constable mr hayman acknowledged that binge drinking did cause problems. if you come to norwich on a friday or saturday night you will see things going on that will you make you feel ashamed. however i want industry to succeed in norwich and i want norwich to be the recognised nightspot of east anglia. there is no way i want to say we cannot manage it or police it. we can.
688,lions blow to world cup winners british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year s rbs six nations championship. world cup winners lawrence dallaglio neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer s tour to new zealand. i don t think you can ever say never said woodward. but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby. dallaglio back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last months but continue to star for their club sides. but woodward added: the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark. my job along with all the other senior representatives is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team. if you are not playing international rugby then it s still a step up to test rugby. it s definitely a disadvantage. i think it s absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries. woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open. it is an open book he said. there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries. and following the all blacks impressive displays in europe in recent weeks including a - humiliation of france woodward believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge. their performance in particular against france was simply awesome said the lions coach. certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five but they re a very powerful unit. with his customary thoroughness woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland. as a result woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots. scotland s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances. eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions. and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems. i took lessons from in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn t fit and went on the trip. every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip. i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions - and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat.
596,wilkinson return unlikely jonny wilkinson looks set to miss the whole of the rbs six nations. england s world cup-winning fly-half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship. but rob andrew coach of wilkinson s club side newcastle said that with only two games left to play wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time. it would be irresponsible to put him straight into a test match andrew told the times. wilkinson is recovering from a knee injury which followed long-term neck and arm injuries. he has not played for england since the world cup final in november since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their matches. wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the zurich premiership match against harlequins on march. that game is the day after england play italy in the six nations and six days before their final match of the championship against scotland. we are hoping jonny will be ready in a fortnight but it is touch and go said andrew. his recovery is going very well and the key now is how he is reintroduced to playing and with it goal-kicking. he will probably have to come off the bench to start and it would be ridiculous and irresponsible to put him straight back into a test match. we can t afford to get it wrong with a knee injury. we are in touch with england and they are relaxed about it. despite not playing for england wilkinson is still hoping to make the lions tour to new zealand this summer. lions coach sir clive woodward has not set a deadline for when wilkinson has to start playing again in order to be considered for selection.
324,dj double act revamp chart show dj duo jk and joel are taking over bbc radio s flagship chart show on sunday adding showbiz news celebrity interviews and between-song banter. they hope to boost ratings for the long-running show which has been overtaken in popularity by independent radio s hit uk rundown. radio s chart show is an institution and remains the station s single most popular show says jk also known as jason king. for years people have been tuning in at four o clock with their tape recorders ready to record their favourite tunes. not that i ever did that. but things have moved on a lot now so it was time for a change. that change involved ejecting previous host wes butters and relocating king and dj partner joel ross from their weekend afternoon radio slot. the pair have worked together for a decade - meeting on viking radio in hull before moving to manchester station key and winning two sony radio awards. they also presented gadget series playboyz and car show motor maniacs for cable tv channel granada men and motors and pure soap on bbc three. on the revamped chart show their cheeky laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions film and dvd charts plus a look at future single releases in addition to the singles chart itself. the chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme says ross. the show used to be the only way to discover who was in the top . now you can just click on the internet to find that out so the show has plenty of extra items too. the show s reduced reliance upon the top also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc vinyl or cassette. i personally buy downloads rather than cd singles says -year-old ross. even my grandma can download songs now. jk is still struggling with the technology though. but it s premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead ross adds. while sales of singles on traditional formats are down interest in songs has been revived by download sales which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from april. music fans still want to know what is the most popular song of the week. ross will be plumping for chart success from rapper verbalicious and the stereophonics on sunday while king is more of an r&b and dance music fan. so listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes says king who describes outgoing host butters as an extremely professional and competent broadcaster . the advantage joel and i have is that we re a double act with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive king says. wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him. and if not i could always use a cleaner he jokes. ross says the pair have done their best to ignore the weight of expectation placed upon the revamped show. other people can worry about that we are going to continue doing what we do well he says. at the end of the day this is a radio show that is meant to be entertaining. nobody died.

2189,mobile networks seek turbo boost third-generation mobile () networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services. that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the world congress in cannes last week. fast networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the global mobile suppliers association. at siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to times faster than current networks. the system is not available commercially yet but motorola the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access) a high-speed high bandwidth technology available now. early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second (mbps) compared with less than kilobits per second (kbps) on standard networks. high-speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) - sometimes called super - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to a report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys. a number of companies are developing the technology. nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access. the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers. while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks said dr alastair brydon author of the analysys report: pushing beyond the limits of with hsdpa and other enhancements. the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic wcdma [] he added. motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of . have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor cell using a single hsdpa device. but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution data optimised (ev-do). us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its network at the end of last year. we are expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprint s vice president for technology development when the contract was announced. as part of $ in multi-year contracts announced late last year sprint will spend around $ on ev-do technology from lucent technologies nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of .-. megabits a second and peak download rates of .. the uk-based operator with services in the uk ireland and germany has opted for technology based on hsdpa. using technology from lucent it will offer data speeds of . from next summer on its isle of man network and will eventually support speeds of up to .. us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson. siemens plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but christoph caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of . siemens - in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one. this enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. the speeds offered by mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for licences. but today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dial-up phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of . megabits a second - much faster than . this means users are likely to find disappointing unless the networks are souped up. if they aren t those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. a commercial system could be as far away as though siemens did not rule out an earlier date.
2219,beijingers fume over parking fees choking traffic jams in beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges. car ownership has risen fast in recent years and there are now two and a half million cars on the city s roads. the trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks making motorists reluctant to use them. instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option. the price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable said wang yan an official from the beijing municipal commission for development and reform quoted in the state-run china daily newspaper. mr wang who is in charge of collecting car parking fees said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. indoor parking bays can cost up to % more than outdoor ones. sports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission s road rage. it wants them to use public transport and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. mr wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. indoor parking may be costly but it is not always secure. mr wang s team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to yuan ($; £). the beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic. unclogging beijing s increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the chinese authorities who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the olympic games.

761,oscars steer clear of controversy the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer less contentious cinema. if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches two of the front-runners would have had to be michael moore s bush-baiting documentary fahrenheit / and mel gibson s the passion of the christ. both films polarised opinion but had critics talking and the public turning up to see them - fahrenheit / breaking us box office records for a documentary and the passion of the christ making more than us$ (£) in the us alone. but this year s academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies with the passion of the christ - a film accused of being anti-semitic - receiving nominations only in the minor categories of cinematography makeup and musical score. fahrenheit / has also been overlooked despite winning the palme d or at the cannes international film festival in . moore s caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors decision to enter it in the best picture category rather than best documentary says tim dams the news editor of trade magazine screen international. but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moore s film does not sit well with the academy. if you look at past oscar winners and nominees the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative epic-style pictures. fahrenheit / didn t really fit in to that category. they tend to go for films like titanic gladiator and the lord of the rings films with scale that often aren t too contentious he said. while he said the oscar voting panel were not snubbing moore s film he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. i think it s more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub he said. the problem with mel gibson s film he believed was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic an ancient middle eastern language. hollywood doesn t tend to like foreign-language films - no-one s ever tried doing a film in a dead language he said. but aside from these two films some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. the german film the downfall a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker has been recognised in the best foreign film category. the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man rather than a semi-mythical historical monster. but mr dams said: it s not an inflammatory film. it has done very well in germany and it s a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster. another contentious film mr dams said has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm. independent film-maker morgan spurlock may have forced fast-food giant mcdonalds to withdraw its super size portions in the us after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals - and filmed his progress. the film has been a hit around the world. mr dams said: it s a political film but it s quite fun and punky and well-paced. morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy. it s a very accessible film and it doesn t beat you over the head with its views. while in fahrenheit / there are moments of comedy i think the way that super size me is put together - the fact it s a very likeable film - means it s won through on charm. dam s pick at this year s oscars the aviator martin scorsese s biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes. tinseltown it seems likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.

861,long life promised for laptop pcs scientists are working on ways to ensure laptops can stay powered for an entire working day. building batteries from new chemical mixes could boost power significantly say industry experts. the changes include everything from the way chips for laptops are made to tricks that reduce the power consumption of displays. ever since laptops appeared the amount of time they last between recharges has been a frustration for users. a survey carried out in by forrester research found that the shortness of battery life was the most complained about feature of laptops. the focus back then was more on performance and features said mike trainor chief mobile technology evangelist for chip giant intel. for most of the battery life was stuck on two to . hours. but now he said laptops can last much longer. it was not just a case of improving battery life by squeezing more out of the lithium ion power packs he explained. other changes are needed to get to the holy grail of a laptop running for about eight hours before needing a recharge. lithium ion is never going to get there by itself he said. the industry has done a great job of wringing all possible energy storage out of that technology that they can. some new battery chemistries promise to cram more power into the same space said mr trainor though work still needed to be done to get them successfully from the lab to manufacturing. he was sceptical that fuel cells would develop quick enough to take over from solid batteries even though they have the potential to produce several times more energy than lithium ion power packs. in fuel cells you need to have pumps and separators and evaporation chambers he said. it s a mini energy plant that needs to be shrunk and shrunk and shrunk. intel has been working with component makers to test energy consumption on all the parts inside a laptop and find ways to make them less power hungry. this work has led to the creation of the mobile pc extended battery life (ebl) working group that shares information about building notebooks that are more parsimonious with power. some of the improvements in power use come simply because components on chips are shrinking said mr trainor. intel has also changed the way it creates transistors on silicon to reduce the power they need. on a larger scale said mr trainor improvements in the way that voltage regulators are made can reduce the amount of power lost as heat and make a notebook more energy efficient. also said mr trainor research is being done on ways to cut energy consumption on displays - currently the biggest power guzzler on a laptop. many laptop makers have committed to creating and inch screens that draw only three watts of power. this is far below the power consumption levels of screens in current notebooks. if we can get close to eight hours that s a place that people see as extraordinarily valuable that s what the industry has to deliver mr trainor said.

just over the road from their modern day home. just guests attended with ticket prices at $. the first film to win was wings which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. for the first years or so the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at but in the winners were published in the los angeles times at . meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner. the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous grauman s chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event. other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium. they are now held at the kodak theatre which opened in just across the road from its original home and holds people. until they were held on a thursday then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february. the first televised ceremony was in with bob hope as the mc. who was oscar there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar. one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar. a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article. the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn s first best actress win in . the academy officially adopted the nickname in . the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons. since its inception oscars have been handed out. in support of the war effort the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii. after the war winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in were recovered nine days later. winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. who sits in judgement the academy was set up in as a non-profit organisation with members from different film disciplines. douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. there are now members of the academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy receipt of an academy award nomination achievement of unique distinction earning of special merit or making an outstanding contribution to film. the stars who left empty-handed while many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the academy there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics. among the overlooked films were hobson s choice dirty harry the steps the searchers and king kong. actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer () humphrey bogart in casablanca () gene kelly in singing in the rain () and henry fonda in angry men (). alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in . the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event. there were calls for it to be cancelled in during the war in iraq but as it didn t stop during world war ii or the vietnam war. documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion. the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. los angeles floods in saw it put back a week. the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in as a mark of respect and there was a -hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan. controversies and other gaffes three people have refused oscars including actor george c scott who said the whole thing was demeaning . writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in for his screenplay for the insider because the writers guild was striking at the time. marlon brando turned down his best actor oscar for the godfather in in protest as hollywood s apparent discrimination against native american people. he sent along a woman called sacheen littlefeather to collect his award. she was later revealed to be native american actress maria cruz. the following year robert opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. the tv network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. opal was murdered in . frank capra was the butt of one major gaffe in when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared come on up and get it frank to which frank capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant frank lloyd had won for cavalcade. capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for it happened one night.

841,dominici backs lacklustre france wing christophe dominici says france can claim another six nations grand slam despite two lacklustre wins so far against scotland and england. the champions only just saw off the scots in paris then needed england to self-destruct in last week s - win. the english played better than us but lost whereas we are still in the race for the grand slam said dominici. we know our display was not perfect but we can still win the grand slam along with ireland and wales. france ireland and wales all remain unbeaten after two rounds of this year s rbs six nations with the two celtic nations playing by far the more impressive rugby. france take on wales at the stade de france on february and ireland in dublin on march. but although france have yet to click dominici says that they can still win the hard way as long as scrum-half dimitri yachvili continues in his goalkicking form. if we have an efficient kicker on whom we can rely on a solid defence and a team who play for their lives we can achieve something dominici added. i said at the start of the competition that the winners would be clearer from the third matches and that s exactly what is going to happen. france coach bernard laporte will announce his starting line-up next tuesday for the match against wales. wing jimmy marlu is definitely out with the knee injury sustained at twickenham which is likely to sideline him for the rest of the tournament. inspirational flanker serge betsen is a doubt with a thigh injury but number eight imanol harinordoquy has shaken off his shoulder injury. in the backs centre yannick jauzion and winger aurelien rougerie are all back in contention after injury while brive back julien laharrague has received his first call-up as a replacement for pepito elhorga.
1508,kennedy s cautious optimism charles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election. in his years in the commons he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and he might say the uk s political and electoral system. but even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months time. look i have already said i am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around he said. he still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another labour victory of some sort. and his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the lib dems as the real opposition. but doesn t that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second he is prepared to go this far: a clear conclusion has been reached including by conservatives that the conservatives are not going to win this election. therefore the potential is there for the liberal democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election given that we have the capacity to take on labour and win as well as take on the conservatives and win. this is really going to be the first modern three party uk election that we have all experienced . but haven t we been here before with suggestions in the that labour was finished. won t voters looking for an alternative to labour still naturally gravitate to the conservatives the problem is that geographically the conservative party has melted away in about a third of britain. we have supplanted them as the main alternative to labour in whole tracts of mainland britain. and they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary britain . mr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour voters. he insists his three headline commitments to be financed from a % tax increase on those earning over £ a year will appeal right across the political spectrum. they are to replace the council tax with a local income tax provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fees. he also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to old labour. i think the tax argument has moved on a lot in british politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election he said. under a labour government the tax burden would have to rise while the tories plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible he claims. we are being straightforward with people saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies . that is a clear cut choice for people one i am very comfortable with and i think will distinguish us from the others . as to his own future he is clear. if as expected his party increases its showing at the election he intends to go into the next parliament on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because i see that as the decisive opportunity for us . that last remark reflects a view gaining ground in westminster that if the tories do as badly as some fear the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party. perhaps then mr kennedy will be ready to put some of the caution to one side.
2021,stern dropped from radio stations controversial dj howard stern has been dropped from four us radio stations because he keeps promoting his move to a network broadcasting on satellite. cidatel broadcasting said stern had transformed his show into a continuous infomercial promoting sirius his new satellite radio employer . stern will join the sirius subscription service which is not governed by us regulators next year. citadel pulled stern s show from stations in new york and pennsylvania. stern had been holiday for two weeks but his show did not return to the four stations as expected on january. citadel said it did not yet know whether it would return to its network. stern announced in october that he was leaving conventional radio where his syndicated show goes out across the us for the relatively restriction-free satellite service. the dj s broadcasts are well known for landing in trouble with regulators for obscene and sexually explicit rantings. stern was dropped by six stations owned by media giant clear channel in after it had to pay the federal communications commission $.

917,russia gets investment blessing soaring oil sales and a budget surplus mean russian debt is no longer a risky investment one of the world s leading credit rating agencies says. standard & poor s has classed russian bonds as investment grade up from their former speculative rating. russia s reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant yukos. s&p said the solidity of government finances outweighed the risk. russia is now a net creditor rather than a debtor. gold and foreign currency reserves of $ beat its foreign public debt of some $. the other two major ratings agencies - fitch and moody s have long since upped their rating of russia s sovereign debt. s&p had held back through fear that the government was dragging its feet on economic and legal reforms. now though it has finally followed suit. but the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past. instead with russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales s&p said the government s own debt is looking a good bet. these improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on russia wrote s&p credit analyst helena hessel. the yukos saga is the most high-profile of the political risks to which ms hessel alludes. the company s founder and ex-chief executive mikhail khodorkovsky is in jail on trial for tax evasion and fraud. many believe the real motive for his prosecution is that he threatened to use his wealth to set up a political alternative to president vladimir putin. his company meanwhile is widely believed to have fallen victim to the kremlin s wish to get russian energy resources as far as possible back under state control.

481,thomas out of six nations wales captain gareth thomas has been ruled out of the rest of the six nations with a broken thumb. the full-back will have surgery on monday after fracturing his thumb in the - win over france on saturday. but welsh legend phil bennett insisted wales can cope without thomas as they chase a first grand slam in years. bennett told bbc sport: such is the spirit in the camp they ll put kevin morgan at rhys williams at wing and just carry on. thomas will miss the match against scotland on march and what promises to be a huge encounter against the irish six days later. bennett added: it s a setback. he s a great captain he leads from the front and the boys love him. thomas was replaced at half-time by williams as his side turned around a - deficit in paris. with gareth missing i would think michael owen will be our captain said wales coach mike ruddock. he did a great job in the second half in france. he has been vice-captain all along throughout the championship. wales travel to edinburgh to take on scotland in a fortnight and then host ireland in cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the grand slam and championship decider. bennett an inspirational fly-half for llanelli and wales in the insisted the national team were entering a new golden period. it was a great game and a magnificent result for wales bennett told bbc radio five live s sportsweek programme. the way this young team are blending the glory days are on their way back. we couldn t get possession early on and france dominated and scored two tries. had they been ruthless wales could have gone into the interval points down. but they didn t take their chances. wales defended fairly well but you cannot give that sort of quality ball to good sides. the all blacks would have been ruthless and buried us in the first half. but the character we showed in the second half was quite outstanding.
555,the sound of music is coming home the original stage production of the sound of music is to be performed for the first time in the austrian capital years after the film was released. the first full-scale theatrical production of the musical will make its debut in vienna on saturday. julie andrews starred in the film version of the rogers and hammerstein classic set in the alpine country. but despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time it is barely known inside austria. the film was never shown in any cinema in austria and was not broadcast on television until the early . the musical is based on the true story of the von trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from nazi-occupied austria in . sensitivities about nazism during wartime austria and issues towards the von trapp family themselves could explain austria s reluctance to embrace the musical. another source of irritation for austrians is the song edelweiss which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers. the song was actually an invention by rodgers and hammerstein. many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of austria including yodelling goat-herds and lederhosen. the production is being staged at a viennese opera house the volksoper beginning on saturday. maria the novice nun who falls in love with baron von trapp will be played by austro-australian actress and singer sandra pires.
638,could rivalry overshadow election tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle. along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain. it is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift. ian gibson for example urged the two men to stop squabbling declaring: for goodness sake sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can. those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re-election. tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity. meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue. and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison. lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning. but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage. they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears. and it matters little whether the rift is real or as some try to suggest simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip. few in westminster actually believe that simply because the evidence appears to contradict it. for example the weekend s attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick. even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments. mr blair talked about the new labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor who has long rejected the label. and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year. that claim was repeated in robert peston s book a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act. for his part mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re-elected. the trouble is both men have fallen short of offering simple straightforward denials of the central claims. so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour. the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere. they started with and are sustained by friends of the two men. one only had to listen to the chancellor s friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister s apparent attempts to confound mr brown s leadership ambitions. but it is not just public pronouncements from ex-aides. there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides. it is no secret in westminster for example that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner. then there are the actions of the men themselves. gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign. the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor. meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter which they believe is a media-only obsession or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry. either way there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage. there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation. but with probably only four months to the next election that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off.

1653,file-swappers ready new network legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down. one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january. but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies . in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network. the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised. that file-sharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network. one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to. now the man behind suprnova.org who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed exeem. in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems. like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. there will be no centrally maintained list. this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. an early public version of the software should be available before february. sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development. there were no plans for a linux or mac version. he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. despite suprnova administrator sloncek s involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis. users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream. dr johan pouwelse a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. exeem cannot prevent pollution he said. the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said. studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes. by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that s full of crap like kazaa he said. there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said. mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse. he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. it s hard to compete with free he said. no-one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.
1363,calder fears for scottish rugby former scotland international finlay calder fears civil war at the sru could seriously hamper his country s rbs six nations campaign. four members of the executive board including the chairman david mackay have resigned after a simmering row. and calder said: this is terrible news for every level of scottish rugby. david is a successful businessman and i thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level it was him. mackay s executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee which contains members elected by scotland s club sides. he has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can t be run by amateurs said calder. in fact i don t understand why we are still having this argument years after professionalism arrived. but i don t believe the rest of the sru will take this lying down. i think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and ultimately it is them who pull the strings. so i wouldn t be surprised if they reviewed their position. but in the wider picture what message does this send out he thought the work of scotland s coaches who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side would be made much more difficult. matt williams and willie anderson must be wondering what have we walked into here said calder. and we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the six nations championship. i am very very disappointed more than you can imagine. why do so many scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough

1318,software watching while you work software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a pc but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled. worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. the developers behind the system claim it is a break-through in the way data is monitored and stored. but privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software. the system is a joint venture between security firm and storage specialists bridgehead software. they have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes. more and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the national hi-tech crime unit (nhtcu) a survey conducted on its behalf by nop found evidence that more than % of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime. bridgehead software has come up with techniques to prove to a legal standard that any stored file on a pc has not been tampered with. ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the freedom of information act which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time. the storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm which allows every action on a computer to be logged. potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party copied printed deleted or saved to cd floppy disk memory stick or flash card. other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use. increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data such as governments are using biometric log-ins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time. privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee s privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff. that is not the case said tim ellsmore managing director of . it is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof he said. people need to recognise that you are using a pc as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data he added.
1843,ministers deny care sums wrong ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under-estimated. a report by the fraser of allander institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research. deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research. snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure. the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the care development group of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university s fraser of allander institute. dubious assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another £ by the report warned. it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert. but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland: we don t think we got our sums wrong. obviously we will examine the findings of this new report along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned. we will look in great detail at any contribution to this because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future. and we are absolutely committed to doing that. but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy. ms sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive s support for the policy there were questions which needed to be answered and if necessary sums redone. she said: serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the scottish executive. we need to know that the money is there not just for this year or next year but into the future so that older people and those who are looking forward to older age can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met.

2151,lions blow to world cup stars british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year s rbs six nations championship. world cup winners lawrence dallaglio neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer s tour to new zealand. i don t think you can ever say never said woodward. but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby. dallaglio back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last months but continue to star for their club sides. but woodward added: the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark. my job along with all the other senior representatives is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team. if you are not playing international rugby then it s still a step up to test rugby. it s definitely a disadvantage. i think it s absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries. woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open. it is an open book he said. there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries. and following the all blacks impressive displays in europe in recent weeks including a - humiliation of france woodward believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge. their performance in particular against france was simply awesome said the lions coach. certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five but they re a very powerful unit. with his customary thoroughness woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland. as a result woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots. scotland s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances. eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions. and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems. i took lessons from in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn t fit and went on the trip. every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip. i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions - and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat.

1172,yukos bankruptcy not us matter russian authorities do not have to abide by any us court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant yukos a houston court has been told. legal expert william butler said there was no treaty between the us and russia to recognise the other s legal rulings. that meant moscow would not have to adhere to us rulings in the yukos case. yukos says a us court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its yugansk unit was sold since it has a us subsidiary and local bank accounts. yukos made its surprise chapter bankruptcy filing in houston in december in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of yugansk its main oil producing unit by russian authorities. yugansk was sold to help pay off a $. (£.) back tax bill. it was bought for $. by a previously unknown group which was in turn bought by state-controlled oil company rosneft. the us court s jurisdiction has been challenged by deutsche bank and gazpromneft a former unit of russian gas monopoly gazprom which is due to merge with rosneft. deutsche bank maintains the case has no place in a us court because yukos has no assets in the us apart from two bank accounts and a house in houston owned by its chief finance officer bruce misamore. deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos. it had agreed to loan gazpromneft the money to bid for yugansk. us bankruptcy judge letitia clark who issued an injunction in december to try and prevent the yugansk sale has said she will rule pretty promptly however i do not anticipate ruling on it before next tuesday . yukos has claimed it sought help in the us because other forums - russian courts and the european court of human rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. it has claimed that russia imposed the huge tax bill and forced the sale of yugansk as part of a campaign to destroy yukos and its former owner mihkail khodorkovsky who is facing a -year prison term in russia for fraud and tax evasion. yukos parent company the gibraltar-based menatep group is suing russia in europe for $. in financial damages. the company is also seeking $ in a separate us lawsuit against rosneft and gazprom for their role in the sale of yugansk.
375,election deal faltered over heath role the tories failed to hold onto power in after liberals demanded sir edward heath quit in return for co-operation. documents released after years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime minister following the dramatic february general election. liberal leader jeremy thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government. but it partly collapsed over the conservative leader s own role prompting the queen to ask harold wilson to form a labour government. the february general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control. sir edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis a miners strike and the subsequent three-day week. labour emerged with the most seats - but its mps were short of the number mr wilson needed to form a majority. sir edward who had received more votes but had fewer mps believed he had the authority to remain at number providing the liberal mps would support his government. he said the liberals could keep out labour in three ways: lend ad hoc support to his minority government help draw up the government s programme or have up to three cabinet members in a coalition with the conservatives. according to the documents released at the national archives the friendly and easy first meeting indicated that both sir edward and mr thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal. mr thorpe was in high spirits having just led his party to a historic jump in support. he also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties. but sir edward said that was impossible because the labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a conservative-liberal pact. hours later sir edward s hopes of a deal unravelled as mr thorpe s colleagues refused to support him. jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally reads a telephone memo for mr heath. they feel they could not agree to serve as long as he is the prime minister. asked if this was his own view he said - no it was not i am very close to ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve - it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult. the following day the stickling points had clearly become two-fold: mr thorpe s colleagues wanted electoral reform and sir edward s resignation. mr thorpe told sir edward: i am sorry this is obviously hell - a nightmare on stilts for you. somehow i personally hope that we can work something out. four hours later sir edward called the liberal leader back to downing street in a last attempt at a deal. the minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated. the pm said he was bound to tell mr thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister. mr thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime minister s colleagues. documents show that sir edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a labour-led coalition. but he already knew mr wilson would not form a coalition with either the liberals or the conservatives because of the opposition of the labour left. within hours of his final talks with mr thorpe sir edward told the nation he was resigning and the queen invited mr wilson to form a new minority government.

576,robots learn robotiquette rules robots are learning lessons on robotiquette - how to behave socially - so they can mix better with humans. by playing games like pass-the-parcel a university of hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations. the study s findings will eventually help humans develop a code of social behaviour in human-robot interaction. the work is part of the european cogniron robotics project and was on show at london s science museum. we are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists said professor kerstin dautenhahn project leader at hertfordshire. our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans. the research also focuses on human perception of robots including how they should look and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator. without such studies you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds professor dautenhahn told bbc news online. and i want robots to treat humans as human beings and not like other robots she added. in most situations a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person but also with groups of people. to find out how they would react the hertfordshire cogniron team taught one robot to play pass-the-parcel with children. showing off its skills at the science museum the unnamed robot had to select approach and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye. it even used speech to give instructions and play music. however according to researchers it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the robotiquette for human interaction. if you think of a robot as a companion for the human being you can think of years into the future concluded professor dautenhahn. it might take even longer because it is very very hard to develop such a robot. you can hear more on this story on the bbc world service s go digital programme.

constitution then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. sadly for those who will be directly affected the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs a topic that may excite the bloggers campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain. after all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions and the way it amends article of the european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu s ministerial councils as seems likely it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us. many observers of the computing scene including myself think the results will be disastrous for small companies innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors use of really obvious ideas. in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless amazon lets you because they hold the patent on one-click online purchase. it is a small invention but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it. we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here but perhaps not for long. the new proposals go back to although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-. they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made endorsed by the council of ministers radically modified by the european parliament and then re-presented in their original form. some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. poland has rejected the proposal and germany s main political parties have opposed it but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position but according to those present it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned. the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an a item and can only be approved or rejected. no discussion or amendment is allowed. so why should we be worried first there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. this goes to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. if coders are treated like this today who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow more directly once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else s patent. this is not about stealing software as code is already protected by copyright. patents are not copyright but something much stronger. a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention even if the other person invented it separately. i have never to my shame managed to read lord byron s childe harold s pilgrimage. if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence. the same does not hold for a patent. if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files then i am in trouble under patent law at least in the us. coincidence is no defence. the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. they have legal departments and more crucially patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders. even this system breaks down of course as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer (and other browsers) infringed an eolas patent. that one was eventually thrown out but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. but small companies and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. much of the really useful software we use every day programs like the apache web server the gnu/linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. the damage to software will not happen overnight of course. if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. and it will damage europe s computer industry. we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.

349,speak easy plan for media players music and film fans will be able to control their digital media players just by speaking to them under plans in development by two us firms. scansoft and gracenote are developing technology to give people access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control. they want to give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car or at home or on the move. huge media libraries on some players can make finding single songs hard. voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections said ross blanchard vice president of business development for gracenote. these applications will radically change the car entertainment experience allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel he added. gracenote provides music library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as apple s itunes. the new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual song or movie out of a collection just by saying its name. users will also be able to request music that fits a mood or an occasion or a film just by saying the actor s name. speech is a natural fit for today s consumer devices particularly in mobile environments said alan schwartz vice president of speechworks a division of scansoft. pairing our voice technologies with gracenote s vast music database will bring the benefits of speech technologies to a host of consumer devices and enable people to access their media in ways they ve never imagined. the two firms did not say if they were developing the technology for languages other than english. users will also be able to get more information on a favourite song they have been listening to by asking: what is this portable players are becoming popular in cars and a number of auto firms are working with apple to device interfaces to control the firm s ipod music player. but with tens of thousands of songs able to be stored on one player voice control would make finding that elusive track by elvis presley much easier. the firms gave no indication about whether the ipod or any other media player were in mind for the use of the voice control technology. the companies estimate that the technology will be available in the fourth quarter of .
1201,parmalat sues banks over crash parmalat has sued banks as it tries to reclaim money paid to banks before the scandal-hit italian dairy company went bust last year. the firm collapsed with debts of about euros ($; £) and new boss enrico bondi has already taken legal action against a number of lenders. he claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions. parmalat has not identified which banks it has gone after this time. under italian law administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble. the firm also said it is preparing further law suits. according to the reuters news agency of the companies sued on thursday are italian while the remaining are international. the unidentified parmalat source also told reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of financial institutions. among those already targeted are bank of america ubs credit suisse first boston deutsche bank and citigroup. it has also gone after auditors grant thornton. they have all denied any wrongdoing. parmalat was declared insolvent in december after it emerged that euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist. in the investigation that followed it became apparent that the company among other things had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet. that enabled parmalat to borrow heavily and expand overseas allowing it to become a darling of the italian stock exchange.
1711,souness backs smith for scotland graeme souness believes walter smith would be the perfect choice to succeed berti vogts as scotland manager. souness s former assistant at rangers is hot favourite to take over from vogts who resigned on monday. walter is most definitely the ideal candidate for that job. he d be perfect for it souness told bbc sport. the scottish football association has appointed tommy burns as provisional caretaker-boss for the friendly against sweden on november. he fits the bill because of his knowledge and understanding of the scotland team and football. he is experienced and has been successful. souness added: walter is a real football person as i know from working with him at ibrox. on top of all that he is a proper human being who would command the instant respect of the players and everyone involved in scottish football. souness joined sir alex ferguson in backing smith s claims. the scottish football association is about to embark on the search for vogts successor after appointing tommy burns in a caretaker capacity. ferguson said: he (smith) would be the outstanding candidate as far as i m concerned. you need somebody who knows what they re doing and walter would bring a wealth of experience to the job. the man utd boss continued: i don t know what credentials are needed to do the job but it s a job that needs a lot of experience. he was my assistant with scotland and here at manchester united and he has also managed glasgow rangers. he would need to change the whole shape of scottish football and radical changes are needed. smith was assistant to ferguson at the world cup in mexico in . the former everton and rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as manchester united assistant last term. bbc sport understands that smith would be willing to discuss taking over if he was approached by the scottish fa. if he is tempted to take over it seems almost certain smith s long-time right-hand man archie knox would also play a part in the national team set-up. smith already has the backing of many pundits and fans including former scotland manager craig brown. brown said: walter is an outstanding candidate without doubt. he would be admirable choice. i spoke to him on sunday and i got the impression he would take it. he was asking me about it and i was positive. other candidates for the job include former scotland midfielders gordon strachan and gary mcallister and vogts assistant tommy burns.

1590,blair moves to woo jewish voters tony blair has pledged to never ever ever attack tory leader michael howard over his jewish beliefs. the prime minister told the jewish chronicle: if you look at what i do i attack michael howard politically. mr blair also distanced himself from recent labour campaign posters featuring mr howard which critics claimed were anti-semitic . these were not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the jewish community mr blair insisted. one poster depicted mr howard and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin who is also jewish as flying pigs. another pictured the tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain which critics said echoed the jewish money lender shylock in shakespeare s merchant of venice. others compared the image to the character fagin in charles dickens oliver twist. labour has since taken the designs of its website saying members had preferred other designs. during his interview with the jewish chronicle mr blair said: i ve been a very strong supporter of the jewish community and israel and will always be so. pressed on whether he would draw attention to mr howard s jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract muslim support he replied: the idea that i would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. it s untrue. if you look what i do i attack michael howard politically. i would never ever ever attack him on that basis. mr blair also defended his party s attitude towards the jewish community pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the holocaust memorial day. he added that labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism. neither the conservatives nor the liberal democrats wished to comment on mr blair s words. the prime minister was speaking as london s labour mayor ken livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a jewish reporter from the city s evening standard newspaper. mr blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter oliver finegold to a concentration camp guard. mr livingstone should have withdrawn the comment immediately once he realised the journalist was jewish said mr blair. i m sure that is what in truth he wants to do. well he should do it. mr livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. he conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if mr blair asked.
54,rovers reject third ferguson bid blackburn have rejected a third bid from rangers for scotland captain barry ferguson bbc sport has learnt. it is thought blackburn want £ for the midfielder but chief executive john williams has confirmed the club are still in dialogue with rangers. the -year-old has already handed in a transfer request at ewood park as he seeks a return to ibrox. but the clubs have been unable to reach agreement over a fee for ferguson who moved to lancashire in for £.. on thursday rangers said they would not be increasing their offer of £. blackburn have said all along that they want £ for the midfielder and williams has rejected proposals from rangers over a player-swap deal. williams said: we are in dialogue with glasgow rangers but we have no agreement. the negotiations will have to be concluded by midnight on monday when the winter transfer window shuts. williams conceded any deal for ferguson was looking unlikely before the close of the transfer window but rangers still had a chance to seal the deal. we have no comment to make other than we have not got an agreement with glasgow rangers he added. the way things are looking i think it is unlikely we are going to. the ball is in their court but we have not got an offer that is acceptable at this moment. it is understood that blackburn accepted a £ offer for ferguson from everton at the weekend. but the player is determined to return to scotland and rejected a move to goodison park. ferguson did not play in the fa cup win over colchester on saturday despite recovering from a groin injury with rovers boss mark hughes claiming it had been an emotional and difficult time for the player.
837,sec to rethink post-enron rules the us stock market watchdog s chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new us corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms. in a speech at the london school of economics william donaldson promised several initiatives . european firms have protested that us laws introduced after the enron scandal make wall street listings too costly. the us regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the sarbanes-oxley act. the act comes into force in mid-. it obliges all firms with us stock market listings to make declarations which critics say will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts. firms that break the new law could face huge fines while senior executives risk jail terms of up to years. mr donaldson said that although the act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms the securities and exchange commission (sec) would continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements . there are few if any who disagree with the intentions of the act which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. but european firms with secondary listings in new york have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. the act also applies to firms with more than us shareholders a situation many firms without us listings could find themselves in. the -shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy a delisting. mr donaldson said the sec would consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process for foreign firms unwilling to meet us requirements. we should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections without turning the us market into one with no exit he said. he revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the act s least popular measure - section - for foreign firms. seen as particularly costly to implement section obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm s internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. the sec has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including us ones - with market capitalisations below $ (£). a delegation of european firms visited the sec in december to press for change the financial times reported. it was led by digby jones director general of the uk s confederation of british industry (cbi) and included representatives of basf siemens and cadbury schweppes. compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of us listings. air china picked the london stock exchange for its secondary listing in its $. (£) stock market debut last month. there are also rumours that two chinese state-run banks - china construction bank and bank of china - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in new york later this year. instead the cost of sarbanes-oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in hong kong according to press reports in china.
823,rank set to sell off film unit leisure group rank could unveil plans to demerge its film services unit and sell its media business reports claim. rank formerly famous for the carry on series will expose the shake-up at the announcement of its results on friday the sunday telegraph reported. advisors goldman sachs are understood to have valued its demerged deluxe film unit at £ the report added. speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since rank announced a study into a possible demerger in september. since mike smith s appointment as chief executive in the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses including the odeon cinema chain and the pinewood studios. the move left the group with three core divisions: gaming hard rock and deluxe films which provides technical services to hollywood studios. rank now aims to concentrate on its gaming bars and hotels business including extending its hard rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. it also owns deluxe media which makes and distributes dvds and videos. however that business is seen as less successful. last year it made profits of £. on a turnover of £. and experts suggest its success in moving to dvds from vhs video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. a spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on friday. analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to £ from £ last year. formed in the the firm was a leading uk film producer and cinema owner for many years. it has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the uk - including hotels roadside service areas and holiday centres. it now owns grosvenor casinos the mecca bingo chain and more than hard rock cafes in countries.
2131,millions go missing at china bank two senior officials at one of china s top commercial banks have reportedly disappeared after funds worth up to $ (£) went missing. the pair both worked at bank of china in the northern city of harbin the south china morning post reported. the latest scandal at bank of china will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that china s big four banks are ready for international listings. government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. bank of china is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. the other is china construction bank. both are expected to list abroad during . they shared a $ state bailout in to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut. however a report in the china-published economic observer said on monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in new york because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the enron scandal. bank of china is the country s biggest foreign exchange dealer while china construction bank is the largest deposit holder. china s banking sector is burdened with at least $ of bad debt according to official data though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. officially one in five loans is not being repaid. attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. the most high-profile case involved the ex-president of bank of china wang xuebing jailed for years in . although he committed the offences whilst running bank of china in new york mr wang was head of china construction bank when the scandal broke. earlier this month a china construction bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case. china s banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. the introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector but links between banks and local government remain strong. last year china s premier wen jiabao targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. china s leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of china s economic boom. but two problems persist. first inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. second many questionable loans come not from the big four but from smaller banks. another high profile financial firm china life is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the us securities and exchange commission following its new york listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.

16,howard backs stem cell research michael howard has backed stem cell research saying it is important people are not frightened of the future. the controversial issue was a feature of the recent us presidential election where george bush opposed extending it. but the tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of alzheimer s parkinson s and motor neurone disease. i believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses he said. the use of embryonic stem cells in the uk is already allowed. stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body s tissue types. scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney heart or even brain tissue. mr howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. but he argued: we mustn t be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future. politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. with the life expectancy of the average briton now around the mid- society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people s lives as they grow older. i know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. they are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls. i respect those concerns. but i also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like parkinson s multiple sclerosis motor neurone disease alzheimer s and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems. mr howard acknowledged there were no easy answers over such an issue but it was necessary to have the courage to do what we know to be morally right . he added: of course stem cells are still a recent discovery. more research needs to be done. but we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way. the hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved. former superman actor the late christopher reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident. mr howard made his remarks during a speech in westminster to the conservative national women s committee on ambitions and values.
258,italy - wales wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in rome. tries from jonathan thomas tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a - half-time advantage. luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second-half efforts from brent cockbain shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory. fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year s tournament. starting full of confidence after their victory over england the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half. his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short the ball was switched left and michael owen s long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in. stephen jones who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson s heroics against england slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass and italy hit back out of the blue in the minute. henson sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. with the welsh line-out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum the home side s forward power brought them back into it. but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch. wales regained control with a second try in the minute henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his test try. jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy. henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space. henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to martyn williams the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post jones adding the conversion. italy who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before half-time built up a head of steam on the resumption. de marigny landed a penalty to make it - and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. their fourth after minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams who beat several players with ease and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain. before italy could recover from that blow a strong surge from gareth thomas and great off-loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over. with jones converting both for a - lead wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner. the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe. but after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in years they will travel to paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders. r de marigny; mirco bergamasco w pozzebon a masi l nitoglia; l orquera a troncon; a lo cicero f ongaro m castrogiovanni s dellape m bortolami (capt) a persico mauro bergamasco s parisse. g intoppa s perugini ca del fava d dal maso p griffen m barbini kp robertson. g thomas (capt); h luscombe t shanklin g henson s williams; s jones d peel; g jenkins m davies a jones; b cockbain r sidoli; j thomas m williams m owen. r mcbryde j yapp i gough r sowden-taylor g cooper c sweeney k morgan. andrew cole (australia).

762,celtic make late bid for bellamy newcastle striker craig bellamy is discussing a possible short-term loan move to celtic bbc sport understands. the welsh striker has rejected a move to birmingham after falling out with magpies manager graeme souness. the toon boss vowed bellamy would not play again after a bitter row over his exclusion for the game against arsenal. celtic are in no position to match birmingham s £ offer but a stay until the end of the season could suit bellamy while he considers his future. according to bellamy s agent the player dismissed a permanent move to birmingham. and it is unlikely that newcastle would allow the player to go on loan to another premiership club. bellamy was fined two weeks wages after a live tv interview in which he accused souness of lying following a very public dispute about what position bellamy should play in the side. souness said: he can t play for me ever again. he has been a disruptive influence from the minute i walked into this football club. he can t go on television and accuse me of telling lies. chairman freddy shepherd described bellamy s behaviour as totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional .
602,pension hitch for long-living men male life expectancy is much higher than originally estimated leading pension researchers have said. the pensions policy institute (ppi) said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated. life expectancy at birth is years for a manual worker and years for a professional - a gap of eight years. but if measured at age instead the ppi said a manual worker will live to years and a professional worker to years - a gap of just five years. the ppi s estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy. the government has ruled out raising the state pension age because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies. chris curry ppi research director said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged. even people in social class v [unskilled manual workers] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live years after state pension age he said. researchers have not updated life expectancy projections for women who on average live longer than men.

776,talks aim to avert pension strike talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend. five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour s spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from to . up to . workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for march. however all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days britain s biggest union unison will start balloting local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers. the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the less painful option our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice he said. if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. in the century it s completely unacceptable. unison s workers the transport and general workers union s and amicus are among those being balloted about a march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.
1253,chris evans back on the market broadcaster chris evans has begun selling thousands of his possessions from a stall in camden market london. evans perched on a stool as shoppers wandered around the open-fronted shop packed with his furniture. among the items from his homes in los angeles and london were countless sofas chairs pictures beds and memorabilia from his past tv shows. asked the reason for the sale evans said: i just want to get rid of it all it s just a headache. he added: it feels good to be selling this stuff it s a weight off my mind. look at it all there s so much clutter. i ve enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but it s not important anymore. the normally gregarious evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusiness-like figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his aladdin s cave. however the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the british public in shows such as channel s gameshow don t forget your toothbrush. the most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size. sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four. the elaborate nature of the pieces many custom-made had to be admired particularly a huge red and gold upholstered throne and a stripy deckchair from the queen mary liner. to help people in their browsing evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful often comic aside. isn t it great was the comment on the £ throne and bob dylan s old sofa - honest was written on a dark wood couch priced £ . the prices were steep by a lot of people s standards but evans said it was not deterring shoppers. i ve sold quite a lot already. everything here is on sale for less than i bought it for but it s not really about the money. it s about getting rid of it all. we ve all been bartering that s what it s all about. he added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making. vintage tv and film posters also lined the walls including a rare portrait of raquel welch and an original advertising print from the benny hill show. and almost hidden at the back of the lock-up were the two giant toothbrushes from his former channel show although these were not for sale. despite the sheer curiosity value of the sale there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds. some wandered in just to browse as they would any of the other stalls not knowing that it belonged to evans. paul burgess said: i didn t realise. i thought it was just a load of junk. i should go back and have a better look. but local resident francesca detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original photograph of the who by david wedgburg. ms detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying £ for the print. if you like something you don t really count it like that she said. martin hellewell who had also made a point of visiting evans shop said he thought it was a great idea. why not if you ve got stuff to get rid of it s a good place to do it said mr hellewell. evans has taken out the stall with business partner pete winterbottom. they plan to open every day if possible although evans did not know how often he would be there. we ll stay definitely until christmas and then maybe a week after that said evans.

2184,japanese mogul arrested for fraud one of japan s best-known businessmen was arrested on thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data. yoshiaki tsutsumi was once ranked as the world s richest man and ran a business spanning hotels railways construction and a baseball team. his is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in japan over business scandals. he was taken away in a van outside one of his prince hotels in tokyo. there was a time when mr tsutsumi seemed untouchable. inheriting a large property business from his father in the he became one of japan s most powerful industrialists with close connections to many of the country s leading politicians. he used his wealth and influence to bring the winter olympic games to nagano in . but last year he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of seibu railways one of his companies. under japanese stock market rules no listed company can be more than % owned by its largest shareholders. now mr tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. seibu railways has been delisted from the stock exchange its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid. mr tsutsumi s fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in japanese companies. his determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. the illegitimate third son of a rich father who made his money buying up property as japan rebuilt after world war ii he has described the demands his father made. i felt enormous pressure when i dined with him and it was nothing but pain tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in . he scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. he didn t let me use the silk futon saying it s a luxury. there have been corporate governance issues at some other japanese companies too. last year twelve managers from mitsubishi motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from japan s troubled ufj bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank s bad loans.

672,microsoft plans safer id system microsoft is planning to make windows and internet explorer more secure by including software to give people more control over personal information. info cards will help people manage personal details on their pcs to make online services safer said microsoft. microsoft s two previous programs passport and hailstorm aimed to protect users but were criticised. id fraud is one of the uk s fastest-growing crimes with criminals netting an estimated £. last year. a quarter of uk adults has either had their id stolen via hi-tech or other means or knows someone who has a recent report by which magazine found. microsoft is developing a new version of internet explorer browser and its operating system windows which has been code-named longhorn. michael stephenson director in microsoft s windows server division would not confirm however whether the new info cards id system will be built into the current windows xp version or longhorn. we re trying to make the end-user experience as simple as possible mr stephenson said. the system would differ from its previous attempts to make online transactions more secure said microsoft. while passport and hailstorm stored user information centrally on the net the latest system will store data on a user s pc. it s going to put control of digital ids into the hands of an end-user the end-user will be in full control said mr stephenson. hailstorm was criticised by privacy campaigners for putting too much sensitive information into the hands of a single company. passport provides a single log-in for more than one website and stores basic personal information. but its popularity suffered after security scares. up to million passport accounts were left vulnerable to online theft and malicious hackers after a flaw in the system was exploited in . online auction site ebay stopped supporting it in january . although the flaw was fixed microsoft has come under regular criticism for the number of security loopholes in internet explorer. last year it released a major security update for windows service pack to combat some of the security concerns. longhorn is due to be released commercially in late but an updated version of internet explorer is due for release later this year.
2010,fast moving phone bugs appear security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs. the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. the cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the symbian series phone operating system. despite the warnings there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir. the original cabir worm came to light in mid-june when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. a mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time. however the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. users can protect themselves by altering a setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices. finnish security firm f-secure issued a warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone s battery. anti-virus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by a brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. so far seven versions of cabir are know to exist one of which was inside the malicious skulls program that was found in late november. symbian s series software is licenced by nokia lg electronics lenovo panasonic samsung sendo and siemens.

459,fuming robinson blasts officials england coach andy robinson insisted he was livid after his side were denied two tries in sunday s - six nations loss to ireland in dublin. mark cueto s first-half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes. [i m] absolutely spitting. i m livid. there s two tries we ve been cost robinson told bbc sport. we ve got to go back to technology. i don t know why we didn t. south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the sale wing to gather. kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try. i think mark cueto scored a perfectly legal try and i think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey said robinson. it is how we use the technology. it is there and it should be used. i am still trying to work out the cueto try. i have looked at both and they both looked tries. we are very disappointed and this will hurt there is no doubt about that. we are upset now but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that. we did everything we could have done to win the game. i am very proud of my players and with a couple of decisions this could have been a very famous victory. i thought we dominated. matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop while the likes of charlie hodgson martin corry and lewis moody all came through well. josh lewsey was awesome and every one of the forwards stood up out there. given the pressure we were under credit must go to all the players. we have done everything but win a game of rugby but ireland are a good side. they defended magnificently and they ve got every chance of winning this six nations. england have lost their first three matches in this year s six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september.

1730,guantanamo pair s passport ban the government has written to two of the british men freed from guantanamo bay telling them they will not be allowed passports. a letter sent to martin mubanga said his british passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the us. this suggested he was likely to take part in action against uk or allied targets if he left britain it said. an identical letter has been sent to feroz abbasi the men s solicitor says. it is not known whether the other two men released from the cuba detention camp in january - richard belmar and moazzam begg - have also received letters. the government is implementing the rarely used royal prerogative in order to withdraw the men s passports. it is only the time the power has been used since - the last time was in . the letter from the home office says: i am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the united states the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that on leaving the united kingdom you would take part in activities against the united kingdom or allied targets. the home office said it could not comment on individual cases. the liberal democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the us in order for the men to be allowed home from guantanamo bay. home affairs spokesman mark oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture. he added: the power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and i find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time. he said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the royal prerogative. the liberal democrats have promised to raise the issue in parliament. amnesty international uk also questioned whether the decisions had been based on torture evidence obtained at guantanamo bay. furthermore we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the uk in the detention of uk residents and nationals and possibly many others at guantanamo bay said director kate allen. the men s solicitor louise christian has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. but the pentagon told bbc news us policy condemns and prohibits torture and said there was no evidence that any british detainee was tortured or abused. mr abbasi from croydon south london was taken to guantanamo bay after being captured in afghanistan in . mr mubanga from north london was originally detained in zambia.

911,warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. however dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. the link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. the message s subject line reads urgent tsunami earthquake appeal and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts. the web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. patricia sanders spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down. she said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered. it is thought that the fake site is being run from romania. ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web. dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. bt and dec s hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down she said. ms sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not dec s style and that it would never canvass support in this way. she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed. none of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records. this is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid. one e-mail sent out in early january came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the netherlands. the con was very similar to the familiar nigerian forward fee fraud e-mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile. other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information. in a monthly report anti-virus firm sophos said that two e-mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top hoax list during january. another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of microsoft s outlook e-mail program. anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to.

1543,best person for top legal job the best person for the job should be appointed lord chancellor and not necessarily a lawyer or mp the courts minister has told mps. under reforms the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions. the lord chancellor...no more needs to be a lawyer than the secretary of health needs to be a doctor said courts minister christopher leslie. the constitutional reform bill was entering its second reading on monday. mr leslie said: the prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the house of lords or the house of commons. under the reforms the law lords will also be replaced as the uk s highest legal authority by a supreme court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers. in december the lords rejected a plea by current lord chancellor lord falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer. the peers voted by to to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers. the debate was carried over from the last parliamentary session but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the bill passed. mr leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called secretary of state for constitutional affairs or lord chancellor. he said: what matters most is...whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties. it is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges. shadow attorney general dominic grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an exceptional institution providing a champion of the independence of the judiciary . the government had initially proposed to take this institution and smash it to pieces mr grieve said. convention should be nurtured and celebrated but the government distrusted and disliked it instead. he warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the house of lords the government would have great difficulty in getting the bill through parliament. former cabinet minister douglas hogg whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor said the bill was largely unnecessary bureaucratic and expensive . but the tory mp for sleaford and north hykeham admitted the lord chancellor s role and office cannot be frozen in aspic .

1454,can yahoo dominate next decade yahoo has reached the grand old age of and in internet years that is a long time. for many yahoo remains synonymous with the internet - a veteran that managed to ride the dot-com wave and the subsequent crash and maintain itself as one of the web s top brands. but for others there is another newer net icon threatening to overshadow yahoo in the post dot-com world - google. the veteran and the upstart have plenty in common - yahoo was the first internet firm to offer initial public shares and google was arguably the most watched ipo (initial public offering) of the post-dot-com era. both began life as search engines although in when yahoo chose google to power its search facility while it concentrated on its web portal business it was very much yahoo that commanded press attention. in recent years the column inches have stacked up in google s favour as the search engine also diversifies with the launch of services such as gmail its shopping channel froogle and google news. for jupiter analyst olivier beauvillain yahoo s initial decision to put its investment on search on hold was an error. yahoo was busy building a portal and while it was good to diversify they made a big mistake in outsourcing search to google he said they thought google would just be a technology provider but it has become a portal in its own right and a direct competitor he added. he believes yahoo failed to see how crucial search would become to internet users something it has rediscovered in recent years. it is interesting that in these last few years it has refocused on search following the success of google he said. but for allen weiner a research director at analyst firm gartner and someone who has followed yahoo s progress since the early years the future of search is not going to be purely about the technology powering it. search technology is valuable but the next generation of search is going to be about premium content and the interface that users have to that content he said. he believes the rivalry between google and yahoo is overblown and instead thinks the real battle is going to be between yahoo and msn. it is a battle that yahoo is currently winning he believes. microsoft has amazing assets including software capability and a global name but it has yet to show me it can create a rival product to yahoo he said. he is convinced yahoo remains the single most important brand on the world wide web. i believe yahoo is the seminal brand on the web. if you are looking for a text book definition of web portal then yahoo is it he said. it has achieved this dominance mr weiner believes by a canny combination of acquisitions such as that of inktomi and overture and by avoiding direct involvement in either content creation or internet access. that is not to say that yahoo hasn t had its dark days. when the dot-com bubble burst it lost one-third of its revenue in a single year bore a succession of losses and saw its market value fall from a peak of $ to $. at one point. crucial to its survival was the decision to replace chief executive tim koogle with terry semel in may thinks mr weiner. his business savvy coupled with the technical genius of founder jerry yang has proved a winning combination he says. so as the internet giant emerges from its first decade as a survivor how will it fare as it enters its teenage years the game is theirs to lose and msn is the only one that stands in the way of yahoo s domination predicted mr weiner. nick hazel yahoo s head of consumer services in the uk thinks the fact that yahoo has grown up with the first wave of the internet generation will stand it in good stead. search will be a key focus as will making yahoo messenger available on mobiles forging new broadband partnerships such as that with bt in the uk and continuing to provide a range of services beyond the desktop he says. mr weiner thinks yahoo s vision of becoming the ultimate gateway to the web will move increasing towards movies and television as more and more people get broadband access. it will spread its portal wings to expand into rich media he predicts.

130,seamen sail into biometric future the luxury cruise liner crystal harmony currently in the gulf of mexico is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology. as holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes their ship s crew is testing prototype versions of the world s first internationally issued biometric id cards the seafarer s equivalent of a passport. along with the owner s picture name and personal details the new seafarers identity document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder s fingerprints. the cards are due to be issued in february next year in line with the revised un convention on seafarers identity documents of june . tests currently under way in the caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers produced by different companies in different countries are working to interoperable standards. results of the current tests which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities will be published by the international labour organisation (ilo) by the end of november. crystal cruises which operates the crystal harmony is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology. authenti-corp the us technology consultancy has been working with the ilo on its technical specifications for the cards. if you re issued a seafarer s id in your country you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in say my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed authenti-corp s ceo cynthia musselman told the bbc s go digital programme. she said french jordanian and nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new id cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. it aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. the convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor s wellbeing and therefore it says to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. by increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world said ms musselman. it should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are in fact seafarers.

812,ukip could sue veritas defectors the uk independence party could take legal action to unseat two london assembly members who defected to robert kilroy silk s veritas party. damian hockney now veritas deputy leader and peter hulme-cross were elected in on the list system. the party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as ukip representatives not as individuals. mr hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats. ukip chairman petrina holdsworth urged the men to step down from the gla in a letter. she said: the party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you. we would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election. mr hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the gla as it did for other electoral list systems. the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party. he said mr hulme-cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was ukip who were not being true to the electorate. he accused the party of signing up to a deal with the tories in europe rather than sticking to an independent stance. but the claim was denied by ukip spokesman who said: mr hockney s accusations are like his sense of political morals - empty. veritas was formed by mr kilroy-silk earlier this month after he quit ukip following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.

341,s desire to be number one who have won three prestigious grammy awards for their hit vertigo are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world. the most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common. the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive if not always groundbreaking. but such success is down to more than music. they have to be compelling performers charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground. they also have to want it. they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it. the beatles had it the rolling stones still have it rem hold onto it and queen were it in a catsuit. and have it in spades and keep churning it out. their new album how to dismantle an atomic bomb comes years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the all-time rock a-list. they may have lost some of the edginess and raw youthful force that propelled them to the top but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums. vertigo the first single from the new album went straight into the uk singles chart at number one knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their top hit. the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to bono recently said. drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments: we re very competitive - we want to be on the radio have big singles. we don t want to be thought of as a veteran band. the band have done everything in their considerable powers to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world according to q magazine editor paul rees. this makes them hugely determined and formidable. he added: they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up. as such they ve constantly re-invented and challenged themselves. they are perhaps alone as the only rock band that has got better with age. the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised mr rees said. they do everything in the right way. the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board attracting fellow pupils paul hewson (bono vocals) adam clayton (bass) david evans (the edge guitar) and his brother dick. dick evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on . by they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager paul mcguinness. they were brilliant but very coarse mcguinness recently said. in a way they were doing exactly what they do now. only badly. they struggled to attract record company attention later being described as pretty damn average and strange and eerie by scouts who saw them live. they released two ireland-only singles which topped the national charts in and leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy. the stadium-filling anthemic sound was s aim from the start and their third album war saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic going to number one in the uk and in the us. songs like sunday bloody sunday and new year s day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which bono rejected as a cliche. his stage performances - which included flag-waving speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation as an electric performer and their appearance at s live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom. in the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name i still haven t found what i m looking for and with or without you. those songs took the band s epic atmospheric sound to a simple powerful and popular pinnacle. the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements. these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music plus wildly extravagant stage shows while still trying to retain their mass appeal. the achtung baby album in was followed by zooropa pop and their corresponding stadium tours which featured giant olives flying cars live phone calls to the white house and bono s transformation into alter-egos the fly and macphisto. he was also building a parallel reputation - not always to the pleasure of his bandmates - as a campaigner on issues from global debt to aids. before the release of how to dismantle an atomic bomb they had sold million albums around the world. but they still want more.

1347,mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. the cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which % of members would be elected. mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since when hereditaries lost their seats. the group says it can win support for removing the last hereditaries. the government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. tony blair has argued. there needs to be consensus on reforms. there have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour s manifesto. but the all-party group including tories ken clarke and sir george young labour s robin cook and tony wright and liberal democrat paul tyler is confident its plan would win support from a large majority . and they list former conservative leader william hague and former labour leader neil kinnock as supporters of the plans. the group says the british public and a clear majority of mps support replacing the lords with a largely-elected second chamber. their plan would see the house of lords being renamed the second chamber of parliament and its members would be known as mscps. there would be mscps including elected members appointed members and bishops. they would serve for between and years. mr cook said holding elections for mscps on the same day as those for mps might help motivate the electorate and increase voter turnout. he added: over the last year i have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice. what could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our parliament the group believes pressure is growing for change and the government s current position is unsustainable. it wants all three main parties to include a commitment to a largely democratic second chamber in their manifestos. mr clarke said the issue went to the heart of reforming the health of the british political system . and mr tyler said the prime minister s view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the lords was flawed. the problem i think in the prime minister s mind is there doesn t appear to be a consensus that includes him he said. we are providing a consensus . the elect the lords campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate. we believe this draft bill is detailed enough to form the basis of closer parliamentary scrutiny said co-ordinator peter facey. in lieu of any other such clear proposals the government must permit that to happen.
1110,what high-definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition. high-definition gives incredible -like pictures and surround sound. the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment. for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy finding nemo the incredibles and indiana jones. there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website. the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined. the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says. but currently putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand. as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains. i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting. high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to. it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in months time. mr dean is confident though: i think if they see real hd [high-definition] not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference. i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen. high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. on the whole producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd. when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about . gigabits per second says mr dean. our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second. that s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about %. so if you have anything that allows more space you don t have to compress so hard. studios could fit a lot more marketing material games and features onto high-capacity dvds. currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean. although the step of down-converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save a day s work says mr dean. one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems. on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took human hours alone. if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay. if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required. and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd. but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean. high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike. more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous. when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i everybody was very sun-tanned but that was make-up. in the hd version of episode i all these make-up lines showed up explains mr dean. the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too. there are scans of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways. you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn t see it. what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further. it could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen. in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol - broadband] giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive says mr dean. but that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves.

2074,apple sues tiger file sharers apple has taken more legal action to stop online leaks of its new products. the computer giant has sued three men for releasing preview versions of its latest mac osx software onto file-sharing sites prior to its release. it said two versions of the operating system codenamed tiger were put onto the net in october and december. it is the second time in two weeks apple has taken legal action to protect its future products. tiger is due to be shipped in early . last week it filed a lawsuit against unnamed individuals who leaked details about new products onto the web. the latest action was against members of the apple developer connection a group of programmers which gets to see test versions of upcoming software so they can develop or change their own programs to work with them. members of apple developer connection receive advance copies of apple software under strict confidentiality agreements which we take very seriously to protect our intellectual property apple said in a statement. it added that its future financial results were very much dependent on developing and improving its operating systems and other software. it is thought the men used sites which employ bittorrent technology. with bittorrent technology sites do not host actual files being shared instead they host a link that points people to others that have the particular file. last week the motion picture association of america launched a legal campaign targeting websites that operate using the bittorrent system in an effort to clamp down on movie piracy. apple is no stranger to taking legal action against those who leak product information. in december it sued a former contractor who allegedly put drawings images and engineering details of its powermac computer online. the latest action was filed on monday in the us district court in california. it comes just weeks before the macworld conference in san francisco used to showcase new products.
1385,new drink limit would cut toll more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third a report says. university college london research claims cutting the limit from of alcohol per of blood to would save lives a year. the findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government s road safety bill. the bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. the research carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop says cutting the limit would also lead to fewer serious injuries on the uk s roads compared with . he estimates that this would save the country £ a year. a previous estimate contained in a department of transport document suggested such a move could save lives a year. the findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking. professor allsop said: reducing the limit from to can be expected to save around lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver s bac [blood alcohol content] is within of the current limit. only about one in of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times. ministers do not support a lower limit saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties. they believe educating drivers is more important. the aa motoring trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers attitudes to drink-driving. road safety head andrew howard said: it remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut. parliamentarians need to consider this carefully. britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone. liberal democrat transport spokesman john thurso said drink-driving remained a major killer with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking. he said there had been a % drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink-driving. the road safety bill which gets its second reading on tuesday would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court - currently a blood test is needed. it also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over. these have been criticised by road safety campaigners including labour backbencher gwyneth dunwoody who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas leading to more road casualties. in an article for the times newspaper ms dunwoody who chairs the transport select committee says: slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists. it is quite simple: if you hit someone at they have a per cent chance of survival. if you are going at nine times out of ten they will die.

2157,woodward eyes brennan for lions toulouse s former irish international trevor brennan could be one of clive woodward s many surprises when the -man lions tour squad is announced. brennan who last played for ireland against samoa in is held in high esteem by the former england coach. if you speak to the players there s a huge amount of respect for the guy woodward told the sunday independent. players tend to know better than most coaches. it s not just the irish but welsh and english players as well. the -year-old former dublin milkman moved from leinster to toulouse in and immediately picked up a heineken cup winner s medal in an all-french final against perpignan at lansdowne road. brennan is highly-rated at stade toulousain where he is used anywhere in the back five. woodward is ensuring his preparations for the trip to new zealand in june are as thorough as possible. i ve spoken to quite a few players and they probably don t know what they re actually saying when we re having these conversations he told the newspaper. but you talk about certain players and they ll say if they think they re up to scratch or that they don t want them in their team. i haven t heard a bad word said against trevor which considering he has a pretty tough guy reputation is to me impressive.
1825,robertson out to retain euro lure hearts manager john robertson hopes a place in the knock-out stages of the uefa cup could help keep some of his out-of-contract players at the club. it could help. if we get through and have another european tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season he said. if we manage to get through it shows how well the club s progressing. they have to think whether they are going to get other clubs like that should they decide to move on. a win for robertson s side against ferencvaros would put them through to the last if basle fail to beat feyenoord. it s very much the player s prerogative but the fact that we ve been playing european football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive added robertson. but we want players who want to play for the football club who are committed and a run in europe always helps a little bit. with the game being played at murrayfield instead of tynecastle because of uefa regulations robertson sees both positive and negative aspects to the change of venue. the pitch is not in the greatest condition. the heineken cup game was there at the weekend and the pitch is a bit threadbare he said. it s not ideal but it s the same for both teams so we just have to go out and there and perform. that s the most important thing. but he added: if tynecastle could have hosted it would have been fantastic but that s one of the benefits of murrayfield - it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it. there will be a good atmosphere and the hearts fans have an important role to play. we need their encouragement we need them to get right behind the side and make it as good an atmosphere as possible. hopefully the players will respond to that and i know they will because it s a fantastic european night for the club.

1124,uk s useless quangos under fire the uk has quangos financed with billions of pounds of taxpayers cash - many of which are useless or duplicate each other s efforts a report claims. essential guide to british quangos author dan lewis said at least of the appointed bodies had been set up since labour won power in . he urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department. tories and lib dems welcomed the report and called for a slimming down . conservative deregulation spokesman john redwood said: the research endorses our policy of destroying unwanted and unnecessary quangos and slimming down the rest. a conservative government will axe quangos as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government. lib dem spokesman ed davey meanwhile said instead of the bonfire of quangos new labour had promised there had been an explosion of them. for over two decades under both tory and labour governments these unaccountable agencies have mushroomed. liberal democrats would abolish many merge others and make any that remain properly accountable. labour representatives were unavailable for comment. the quango guide follows last year s government-commissioned gershon report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector. mr lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost £. a year - cash he says which appears to be almost entirely wasted . as well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory five-year limit on any such body with executive powers. he also listed what he dubbed the nine most useless quangos . they were the british potato council the milk development council the energy savings trust agricultural wages committees the wine standards board the westminster foundation for democracy the football licensing authority investors in people uk and the economic and social research council. mr lewis branded the existence of the -employee potato council set up in to research and promote overseas potato markets surprising . he said the £ spent annually on the energy savings trust which promotes renewable energy would be better spent on eight million boiler jackets for british homes. and he argued it was absurd to charge farmers for agricultural wages committees which set working and wage standards in the industry when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for £ an hour. if a football team can afford to pay £ for wayne rooney why should the taxpayer - not all of whom like football - be forced to fund the football licensing authority to the tune of over £. a year mr lewis asked. the report is published by the efficiency in government unit - a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the economic research council and the centre for policy studies. it says before a new public body is set up an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation.

($.) offer for the lse was good for shareholder value. reports say standard life which owns a % stake in deutsche boerse may seek a shareholder vote on the issue. fellow shareholders us-based hedge fund atticus capital and uk-based tci fund management have also expressed doubts. deutsche boerse s supervisory board has approved the possible takeover of the lse despite the signs of opposition from investors. the onus is on deutsche boerse s management to demonstrate why the purchase of the lse creates more value for shareholders than other strategies such as a buyback said richard moffat investment director of uk equities at standard life investments. atticus capital holding % of deutsche boerse wants it to buy back its own shares rather than buy the lse. and tci which holds about % has made a request for an extraordinary shareholders meeting to be held to vote on replacing the company s entire supervisory board. it has also demanded that shareholders be consulted about the proposed acquisition and whether the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange should return $ (£) to shareholders instead. in december deutsche boerse which also owns the derivatives market eurex and the clearing firm clearstream put an informal offer of pence per lse share on the table. however the lse said the cash offer undervalued both its own business and the benefits of such a tie-up. since then an improved offer from deutsche boerse has been anticipated as its management has continued talks with lse chief executive clara furse. but the london exchange is also holding talks with deutsche boerse s rival euronext which operates the amsterdam brussels lisbon and paris exchanges as well as london-based international derivatives market liffe.

847,bbc should allow more scrutiny mps have urged the bbc to give watchdogs more freedom to scrutinise how £ in licence fee money is spent. the public accounts committee called for the national audit office to be given a free hand to investigate how the bbc offers value for money. although six areas are to be opened up to scrutiny the audit office should have more power to choose what it investigated the mps said. the call was made in a report into the bbc s freeview digital service. our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of eastenders but simply to ensure that the bbc is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money said the committee chairman mp edward leigh. the bbc s spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny and accountability to parliament. parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general on behalf of parliament to be able to scrutinise how that money over £ billion a year is used. a bbc spokeswoman said: we share the committee s interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well. though in its infancy we think the arrangements with the nao are working well and should be given time to mature. the report said the freeview digital service has had an impressive take up since its launch but the bbc must still dispel confusion about the service. the committee found the bbc had succeeded in ensuring subscription-free access to digital channels following the collapse of itv digital in . but the fact that one in four homes could not access freeview remained a problem. the report said that while gaps in the coverage were largely due to landscape issues there was need for detailed explanations on the freeview website and on promotional literature as to why it was not available in specific areas. the government has proposed switch off of the analogue television signal with the most recently proposed date. the bbc launched freeview in as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as sky to allow its digital channels such as bbc three and news to be seen. there have been an estimated five million freeview set-top boxes sold since the launch and prices have fallen considerably. the corporation plans to spend up to £ on freeview before to ensure people can receive the service throughout the uk and are aware of it.

1720,mandelson warning to bbc the bbc should steer away from demonising ex-downing street media chief alastair campbell peter mandelson has said. the european commissioner and former labour minister was speaking amid claims that mr campbell is part of a labour dirty tricks campaign. that charge was denied by mr mandelson who said the tories were afraid of mr campbell s campaigning skills. he warned the bbc that attacking mr campbell had brought it trouble before. that was a reference to the hutton inquiry following a bbc story claiming downing street sexed up iraq s weapons of mass destruction dossier. the affair prompted the resignation of bbc chairman gavyn davies director-general greg dyke and reporter andrew gilligan. labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about tory leader michael howard s past. mr mandelson a former labour communications director told bbc radio s today programme: i understand why the tories will be gunning for alastair campbell because they fear his campaigning skills. what i understand less is why the bbc should be joining with the tories in driving that agenda. in my experience of these things parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy. i suggest the bbc concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics the trivialisation of the campaign. i think the bbc would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone concentrate on the issues as i say not resume their demonisation of alastair campbell - we all know where that led before. mr campbell is acting as an adviser for labour which denies engaging in personal campaigning. conservative co-chairman liam fox said mr campbell s return and labour poster plans attacking mr howard - recently withdrawn from the party s website - were a sign of abusive politics . the government despite the fact that they would say want to go forward not back seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly about the future he said on sunday. labour peer baroness kennedy who is chairing the power inquiry into political disengagement said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks. this feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might she said.
385,ukip s secret weapon by any measure new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else - a winner. this is the man who some pundits believe was almost single-handedly responsible for bill clinton s sensational comeback victory. but morris is no ideologue. he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and more recently politicians from mexico to uruguay. now he is back in london as the uk independence party s not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate viktor yushchenko. if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances. that he enjoys the game more than the politics. so why britain and why ukip which despite its recent eu election successes is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election. on this subject morris appears almost evangelical. i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and coincidentally so was ukip leader roger knapman. i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there . but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art irrespective of the politics. i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism . a great soundbite but a surprise coming from a new yorker post september. it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better who don t believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined. that s international bankers the world trade organisation the international monetary fund the world bank and primarily the european union . so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic. and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable. the tory party is schizophrenic about europe. but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they can t possibly re-negotiate anything (as michael howard is pledged to do). it s like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying: before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody . possibly a very american analogy but another great soundbite. the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain - and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it . so is ukip s job to destroy the tories as former member robert kilroy-silk once notoriously declared no. the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move. but it s not just to shift the tories. i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair s decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro . and while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites. robert kilroy silk is not a team player - it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one . so what is the big plan for the general election. how will he achieve the breakthrough look we are not going to be forming the next government he said. neither does ukip have to fight every seat. as with the us presidential election he says the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in britain. so with limited resources the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons. he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll. the internet was a decisive factor in the presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries). people just did it . anything can happen in the next general election. there is an inherent instability at the moment. labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice . that might he suggests lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power. it is a huge task surely. but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is labour s for the taking. ukip s performance in last year s european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus. and after all he has a reputation to sustain.
2185,us bank loses customer details the bank of america has revealed it has lost computer tapes containing account details of more than one million customers who are us federal employees. several members of the us senate are among those affected who could now be vulnerable to identity theft. senate sources say the missing tapes may have been stolen from a plane by baggage handlers. the bank gave no details of how the records disappeared but said they had probably not been misused. customers accounts were being monitoring and account holders would be notified if any unusual activity was detected bank officials said. bank of america said the tapes went missing in december while being shipped to a back-up data centre. we with federal law authorities have done a very robust thorough investigation on this and neither we nor they would make the statement lightly that we believe those tapes to be lost alexandra tower a spokeswoman for the north carolina-based bank told time magazine. but although there was no evidence of criminal activity the bank said the secret service - a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime - is said to be looking into the loss. new york senator charles schumer said he was told by the senate rules committee that the tapes were probably stolen from a commercial plane. whether it is identity theft terrorism or other theft in this new complicated world baggage handlers should have background checks and more care should be taken for who is hired for these increasingly sensitive positions the democrat senator said. details of his vermont colleague pat leahy s credit card account are among those missing senator leahy s spokeswoman tracy schmaler said. about military and civilian staff at the defence department are among the . million affected according to a pentagon spokesman.
1367,howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards. the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a collective view after holding a good discussion but admitted it was not an easy issue . he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday. tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo his transport and environment spokesman said the plans stink . he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would set out the position very clearly when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives . he added: when the police say that you have to take them seriously . he acknowledged there were good libertarian arguments against the cards but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the conflicting interests before reaching its decision. i don t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken. he also denied he was afraid of looking soft on the issue compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening. sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme. they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected. it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and deeply flawed . he said: this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues concerns over id cards. the chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists. what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained. tory ex-minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a regressive step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.
843,france starts digital terrestrial france has become the last big european country to launch a digital terrestrial tv (dtt) service. initially more than a third of the population will be able to receive free-to-air channels. despite the long wait for a french dtt roll-out the new platform s backers hope to emulate the success of its uk free-to-air counterpart freeview. recent figures from the uk s regulator ofcom showed freeview was more popular than the sky digital satellite service. in the three months to september almost five times as many people signed up to the uk s free-to-air dtt service compared with sky. almost % of uk households have gone digital on at least one television set through cable satellite or freeview. the french dtt platform is known as tnt which stands for tv numerique terrestre or digital terrestrial television. but it is being branded as television numerique pour tous or digital television for all . tnt is a joint venture between public broadcaster france televisions and a handful of cable and satellite operators. digital terrestrial tv will launch as a free-to-air platform to start with adding pay-tv channels later. thirty-five contenders have bid for an additional eight frequencies on top of the already allocated. a couple of years ago dtt had a bad image said olivier gerolami chief operating officer of tnt. but everyone s impressed with dtt in the uk italy and germany and they realise it is a very good idea. france is the poorest market in europe in terms of free-to-air national channels so it has the potential to be one of the biggest dtt markets mr gerolami added in remarks quoted by the us entertainment industry paper variety. tnt aims to reach % of france s population at launch from transmission sites. the transmission area will initially include paris lille lyon and toulouse. eventually there will be sites reaching over % of homes. digital terrestrial set-top boxes are available from as little as euros (£). a recent survey by mediametrie found that % of people interviewed were aware of dtt and % were planning to buy a digital receiver. consumer electronics companies such as nokia sagem sony and thomson are gearing up for production. the conseil superieur de l audiovisuel (csa) the french broadcasting regulator said: following the recent success of freeview in the uk some manufacturers are optimistic about sales prospects . media analysts believe that initially the majority of viewers will buy inexpensive set-top boxes that are unable to support interactive services. the csa said the current aim of reaching % of the population by was achievable but the future of the remaining tv viewers required action by the public sector. for the most part they are people living in mountainous or border areas which will remain beyond the reach of digital terrestrial tv for years. up to pay-tv channels will launch on dtt between september and march . leading pay-tv operators canal plus and tps have submitted bids to market bouquets of channels. free-to-air services will be broadcast in mpeg- format. but pay-tv operators will be allowed to broadcast in mpeg- - a much better compression technology - which will potentially allow for high-definition (hd) subscription services in the future. tnt expects between and one million dtt set-top boxes to be sold in . it is difficult to tell how quickly it will take off said mr gerolami but we re optimistic that it will revolutionise television in france. other analysts were less optimistic predicting consumers would now be less likely to sign up for pay-tv subscriptions. we think free dtt could put brakes on the underlying growth of pay-tv in france said henri de bodinat vice-president of the arthur d. little consultancy.

(£.) to settle a lawsuit over gun sales violations in california. the lawsuit alleged wal-mart committed thousands of gun sales violations in california between and . the total payment includes $ in fines and more than $ to fund state compliance checks with gun laws and prevent ammunition sales to minors. wal-mart agreed to suspend firearms sales in its california stores in the alleged violations included the sale of guns to people who were not allowed to possess them and delivering guns to customers who acquired them for people not allowed to own firearms. although wal-mart has suspended firearms sales in the state california attorney general bill lockyer said he wanted to be sure the giant supermarket chain would follow state rules in future. wal-mart s failure to comply with gun safety laws put the lives of all californians at risk by placing guns in the hands of criminals and other prohibited persons said mr lockyer. although wal-mart has suspended gun sales in california this settlement will ensure that it follows state law if it renews sales and will also provide valuable public education about the importance of gun safety. the world s largest retailer has not yet decided whether to resume firearms sales in california company spokesman gus whitcomb said.

($.) takeover offer from deutsche boerse claiming that it undervalued the business. lse saw its shares surge .% to a new high of in early trade following the announcement on monday. the offer follows widespread media speculation that euronext would make an offer for lse. experts now widely expect a bidding war for europe s biggest stock market which lists stocks with a total capitalisation of £. trillion to break out. commentators say that a deal with euronext which owns the liffe derivatives exchange in london and combines the paris amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges could potentially offer the lse more cost savings than a deal with deutsche boerse. a weekend report in the telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump deutsche boerse s offer. because we already own liffe in london the cost savings available to us from a merger are far greater than for deutsche boerse the newspaper quoted the executive as saying. euronext chief executive jean-francois theodore is reported to have already held private talks with lse s chief executive clara furse. further reports had suggested that euronext could make an offer in excess of the lse s a share closing price on friday. however euronext said it could not guarantee at this stage that a firm offer would be made for lse. there has been extensive speculation about a possible takeover of the company since an attempted merger with deutsche boerse failed in .

614,spears seeks aborted tour payment singer britney spears is suing eight insurance companies that have refused to reimburse her for cancelling her world tour. the pop star cancelled her onyx hotel tour last june after suffering a knee injury during a video shoot. she is now seeking to be reimbursed for the tour s £ ($.) costs in a claim filed at new york state supreme court. seven london-based companies and an eighth paris firm have been given up to days to respond to the complaint. the -year-old star initially missed a number of shows on the -date tour after injuring her knee during a show in illinois last march. but she was rushed to hospital and needed surgery after a later incident while filming a video for her song outrageous leading her to cancel the rest of the tour including dates in china. she obviously took a wrong step and blew out her knee a jive spokeswoman said at the time. it was an old dance injury. the legal submission described spears as one of the most recognised performers in her industry . the onyx hotel tour was cited as a highly crafted production which included the well-known music and dancing of spears supported by elaborate costumes complex choreography as well as cutting-edge video production lighting and other effects . in september spears married kevin federline who had been a dancer on the aborted tour.
1283,wales critical of clumsy grewcock wales coach mike ruddock says england lock danny grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked dwayne peel. trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of wales - win in cardiff as grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot leaving peel bloodied. grewcock was sin-binned with wales captain gareth thomas for retaliation. it s up to the citing commissioner said ruddock. i m not saying it s deliberate but grewcock did a similar thing for bath against leinster. last june grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against new zealand. six years earlier also in new zealand grewcock became only the second england player to be sent off in tests. the player himself and his captain jason robinson have both said that the clash with peel was accidental. if the ball is at the back of the ruck and i feel i can step over and disrupt it then i will do that said grewcock. but ruddock feels that the england man should be more careful. the boy himself should look at his actions it was a clumsy piece of footwork he said. he s a great player and i don t want to knock him we won t be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident. i m not going to go too far with the lad. it could just be a clumsy action and dwayne had just a minor cut. the referee s interpretation was that grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck. ruddock also warned his rbs nations championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements. we created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually said the coach. we ve looked through things on the video debrief and there were definitely a lot of chances that we wasted. in the forthcoming games ruddock may use penalty hero gavin henson as his first-choice kicker in place of stephen jones. our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team but it s something we ll talk about in selection this week said ruddock.
937,the force is strong in battlefront the warm reception that has greeted star wars: battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay but of its back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient. geared towards online gamers it is based around little more than a series of all-out gunfights set in an array of locations all featured in or hinted at during the two blockbusting film trilogies. previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise s extensive universe and their use of weird and wonderful new characters. battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves. the sights sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for. the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first-person perspective and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player s personal propensity for good or evil. there is ample chance to be a wookie shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired-up luke skywalker. in each section the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet. it really is no more complicated than that. locations include the frozen wastes of hoth the ice planet from the empire strikes back complete with massive mechanical at-ats on the march. there are also the dusty sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis as well as the forest moon of endor where return of the jedi s much-maligned ewoks lived. the feel of those places is well and truly captured with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic. it is worth noting though that on the playstation the game s graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version. the pivotal element behind battlefront s success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large-scale war. the number of combatants noise and abundance of laser fire see to that and the sense of chaos really comes over. speaking of noise battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxy s audio motifs. the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up. there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section. it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars it would not stand up for long. the gameplay is reliable bog-standard stuff short on originality. there are also odd annoyances like the game s insistence on re-spawning you miles away from the action an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear. and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be. that said it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike however non user-friendly they prove. whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game. the above-average ai of the enemy sees to that although given the frenetic environments they operate in their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated. battlefront s novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast leaving behind a slightly empty one-trick-pony of a game. but for a while it is an absolute blast and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas stable.
1005,ukraine revisits state sell-offs ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration. the new president viktor yushchenko has said a limited list of companies is being drawn up. but on wednesday prime minister yulia tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise firms. the government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices. more than businesses in all from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts have been sold off since as the command economy built up when ukraine was part of the soviet union was dismantled. ms tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than businesses which were to be reviewed. we will return to the state that which was illegally put into private hands. a day earlier mr yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only to top firms would be targeted. the list will be limited and final and will not be extended after its completion he said. an open-ended list could further damage outside investors fragile faith in ukraine said stuart hensel of the economist intelligence unit. but the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in russia mr hensel said. as a result it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands. they re aware of the need not to scare investors and to be careful of internal divides within ukraine he said. they don t want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to a new set. foreign investment in ukraine at about $ a head in is one of the lowest among ex-soviet states. mr yushchenko became president after two elections in december the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests. his opponent viktor yanukovich still has huge support in the country s eastern industrial heartland. mr yushchenko s administration has accused its predecessor led by ex-president leonid kuchma of corruption. the privatisation review s number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included viktor pinchuk mr kuchma s son-in-law for $ (£) despite higher bids from several foreign groups. the mill krivorizhstal is one of the world s most profitable. we say krivorizhstal was stolen and at any cost we will return it to the state mr yushchenko told an investors conference in kiev. one of the jilted bidders netherlands-based group lnm said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market. if the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued then we would look at it with great interest a spokesman told bbc news. a resale of krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price according to the economist intelligence unit s mr hensel. but he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale. that way mr yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules he told bbc news.

1612,blair rejects tory terror offer tony blair has rejected a conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti-terror legislation. the tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the anti-terrorism bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in november. mr blair said the bill which brings in house arrest for terror suspects had time limiting safeguards already. the tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. the lib dems also oppose the plans. the government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases. mr blair s refusal to accept the tories sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the lords. peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on thursday. the bill proposes control orders which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. these would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights. the tories want judicial oversight of all control orders not just house arrest. shadow home secretary david davis told bbc radio four s the world at one his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. he said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a recruiting sergeant for terrorists. he went on to say: if we don t get the amendments we regard as essential including the sunset clause we will vote against the bill. in the commons mr howard said it would be far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through . mr blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable. the second less stringent type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by an eminent and independent person . i believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that i will not put at risk said mr blair. the lib dems plan to oppose the bill in the lords on thursday. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: there s a lot of talking left. i would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months. a spokeswoman for human rights watch said it was a basic principle that people should only be punished after a fair trial. she added: having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.

1632,edu blasts arsenal arsenal s brazilian midfielder edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract. edu s deal expires next summer and he has been linked with spanish trio real madrid barcelona and valencia. he told bbc sport: i m not sure if i want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far. if they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and that s made me think. edu s brother and representative amadeo fensao has previously said that arsenal s current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking. and edu added: my brother is due to come to london on thursday. there is a meeting planned for or january to sort it out with arsenal. now i have a choice to stay or go. i want to sort it out as soon as possible that s in the best interests of both the club and myself. i m going to make my decision after the meeting later this week. edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire. the midfielder who broke in to the brazilian national side in admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three spanish giants. edu said: i ve just heard stories from the news that the madrid president florentino perez the valencia people as well as barcelona are interested. that s nice but i ve never talked to them so i can t say they want me sign %. last month wenger said he we was hopeful edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like real madrid would be too strong for edu. edu added that he had been encouraged by wenger s support for him. i still have a good relationship with arsene wenger - he s always said he wants me to sign.
1134,rolling out next generation s net the body that oversees how the net works grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last years but it is just the start. in a sense we have hardly started in reaching the whole population the new chair of the internet engineering task force (ietf) brian carpenter says. the ietf ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net s architecture. with broadband take-up growing services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net. i think voip (voice-over internet protocol allowing phone calls to be made over the net) is very important - it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms says dr carpenter. second it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure. with voip you need very little infrastructure. a distinguished ibm engineer dr carpenter spent years at cern the european laboratory for particle physics. as the new chair of the ietf his next big challenge is overseeing the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web. at cern dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web so he is well-placed to take on such a task. the net s growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the ietf. the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work are open and free for anyone to use and work with. the net is built on a protocol called tcp/ip which means transmission control protocol and internet protocol. when computers communicate with the net a unique ip address is used to send and receive information. the ietf is a large international community of network designers operators vendors and researchers working on the evolution of the net s architecture and the way this information is sent and received. they make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps. we ve seen some interesting effects over last few years explains dr carpenter. the net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the . then there was a bit of a glitch in . we are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth. that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies like china which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies. the number of broadband subscribers via dsl (digital subscriber line) doubled in a year to million according to figures released at the end of . the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate explained dr carpenter. given it [the net] was designed for the whole community it has done well to reach millions. if you want to reach the whole population you have to make sure it can scale up. the standard that will replace the existing will allow for billions more addresses on the net and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world. the actual number of addresses with is limited to four billion ip addresses. that clearly is not enough when you have billion people to serve so there is technical solution the new version of ip - . it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits said dr carpenter. standards are vital to something as complex as the net and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task. the difference this next generation standard will make to the average net user is almost invisible. our first goal is that it [] should make no difference - people should not notice a difference. it is like when the london telephone numbers got longer. a lot of the process will be invisible. people are usually given an ip address without knowing it. technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled said dr carpenter. the one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security. to dr carpenter the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour. people have to be educated about sensible behaviour he says such as ignoring e-mails that claim you have won something. i don t think it is going to get worse. people will remain concerned about security and they probably should do - just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street. we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards. it is a never-ending battle in a sense. but he adds: even if security has improved you still worry a bit. unfortunately it is just part of life. we have a duty to do what we can.

117,chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry telling supporters the stakes are too high to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election. the chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on may - will give a clear and fundamental choice between labour investment and conservative cuts. speaking at labour s spring conference in gateshead mr brown claimed the nhs was not safe in conservative hands. he said tory plans to cut £ tax would cut deep into public service . to a packed audience at gateshead s sage centre the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor oliver letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher gp and nurse in the country he told activists. laying into the conservative s record in government he said: i give you this promise - with labour britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and % inflation % interest rates £ in lost reserves repossessed one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. never again tory boom and bust. this will be the central dividing line at the election between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of £ in our services and a labour government taking britain forward which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals schools and public services and i am proud to say spend by £ more. turning to the economy the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power. he said after seven years labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to the only party trusted with the economy . it was now a party not just of employees but of employers and managers he said. in the speech - which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly warm to mr brown - he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. he also highlighted plans for % debt relief for the world s poorest countries a national minimum wage for and -year-olds and the creation of a network of children s centres and flexibility in maternity leave. the prime minister is to take part later on saturday in an interactive question and answer session fielding queries sent in by e-mail text message and telephone as part of labour s attempt to engage the public in their campaign.
1561,yahoo celebrates a decade online yahoo one of the net s most iconic companies is celebrating its anniversary this week. the web portal has undergone remarkable change since it was set up by stanford university students david filo and jerry yang in a campus trailer. the students wanted a way of keeping track of their web-based interests. the categories lists they devised soon became popular to hundreds of people and the two saw business potential in their idea. originally dubbed jerry s guide to the world wide web the firm adopted the moniker yahoo because the founders liked the dictionary definition of a yahoo as a rude unsophisticated uncouth person. the term was popularised by the century satirist jonathan swift in his classic novel gulliver s travels. we were certainly not sophisticated or civilised mr yang told reporters ahead of the anniversary which will be officially recognised on march. they did have business brains however and in april persuaded venture capitalists sequoia capital which also invested in apple computer and cisco systems to fund yahoo to the tune of $ (£.). a second round of funding followed in the autumn and the company floated in april with less than employees. now the firm employs workers and insists its dot com culture of work hard play hard still remains. it is one of just a handful of survivors of the dot-com crash although it now faces intense rivalry from firms such as google msn and aol. jerry yang who remains the firm s chief yahoo is proud of what the company has achieved. in just one decade the internet has changed the way consumers do just about everything - and it s been a remarkable and wonderful experience he said. through it all we wanted to build products that satisfied our users wants and needs but it s even more than that - it s to help every one of us to discover get more done share and interact.
352,councils prepare to set tax rises council tax in scotland is set to rise by an average of about % in the coming year bbc scotland has learned. authorities will decide final figures on thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation which is currently .%. the finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased. they say much additional government money is for new initiatives. scottish finance minister tom mccabe msp said: last week in parliament i announced an additional £ for core expenditure to local government in scotland. that s a .% increase and sits against an inflation rate of .% so i think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint. mr mccabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years. he told bbc radio scotland s sunday live programme: here in scotland we have councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems. we think there has to be opportunities there for rationalisation and using the money saved to reinvest in frontline services. the councils umbrella organisation cosla which provided bbc scotland with the indicative figures for next year warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services. mr mccabe has promised them about £. next year. however most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services a cosla spokesman said. cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services. they say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending. the conservatives accuse the scottish executive of using the council tax to raise funds because it is too afraid to raise income tax. the tory finance spokesman brian monteith msp said: its a form of disguise... yet again we see that council tax is being used as a way of passing on costs. scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up what we ve seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill. there are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced. linda knox director of the scottish local authority management centre at strathclyde university said: with this current settlement the increase is slowing. at the same time the burdens on councils are greater than they were. the settlement figures don t include pay increases and the executive is also requiring a substantial figure - in the area of £ - in efficiency savings across the settlement period. education will be protected from any cuts but linda knox says this will mean other services will suffer. she said: in practice that will mean a -% cut for other services. on the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about .% but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about % in real terms.
2067,us industrial output growth eases us industrial production continued to rise in november albeit at a slower pace than the previous month. the us federal reserve said output from factories mines and utilities rose .% - in line with forecasts - from a revised .% increase in october. analysts added that if the carmaking sector - which saw production fall .% - had been excluded the data would have been more impressive. the latest increase means industrial output has grown .% in the past year. many analysts were upbeat about the prospects for the us economy with the increase in production coming on the heels of news of a recovery in retail sales. this is very consistent with an economy growing at . to .%. it is congruent with job growth and consumer optimism comerica chief economist david littman said of the figures. the us economy grew at a respectable annual rate of .% in the three months between july and september while jobs growth averaged during the same period. while the employment figures are not spectacular experts believe they are enough to whittle away at america s .% jobless rate. a breakdown of the latest production figures shows mining output drove the increase surging .% while factory output rose .%. but utility output dropped .%. meanwhile the amount of factory capacity in use during the month rose to .% - its highest level since may . many investors think that product market inflation won t be a problem until the utilisation rates are at % or higher cary leahy senior us economist at deutsche bank securities said. so there is still a lot of inflation-fighting slack in the manufacturing sector overall i d say manufacturing at least away from autos continues to improve and i would bet that it improves at a faster rate in coming months given how lean inventories are citigroup senior economist steven wieting added.
18,japanese banking battle at an end japan s sumitomo mitsui financial has withdrawn its takeover offer for rival bank ufj holdings enabling the latter to merge with mitsubishi tokyo. sumitomo bosses told counterparts at ufj of its decision on friday clearing the way for it to conclude a trillion yen ($) deal with mitsubishi. the deal would create the world s biggest bank with assets of about trillion yen ($. trillion). sumitomo s exit ends the most high profile fight in japanese bank history. ufj holdings japan s fourth-largest bank has been at the centre of a fierce bid battle over the last year. sumitomo japan s third-largest bank tabled a higher offer for ufj than its rival valuing the company at $. however ufj s management was known to prefer the offer from mitsubishi tokyo financial group (mtfg) japan s second-largest bank. concerns were also raised about sumitomo s ability to absorb ufj and the former has now admitted defeat. we believe the market and most investors accept a ufj-mtfg merger sumitomo said in a statement. given the ongoing integration of ufj and mtfg operations persisting with our proposal may not be in the best interests of our shareholders or ufj s. mitsubishi s takeover of ufj - which will be japan s largest-ever takeover deal - will still have to be approved by shareholders of the two firms. however this is expected to be a formality. sumitomo may now turn its attention to deepening its ties with daiwa securities another japanese financial firm. the two are set to merge their venture capital operations and there has been speculation that this could lead to a full-blown merger. japanese banks are increasingly seeking alliances to boost profits.
1327,have hackers recruited your pc more than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses. the huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than networks of remotely-controlled machines. the largest network of so-called zombie networks spied on by the team was made up of hijacked home computers. data was gathered using machines that looked innocent but which logged everything hackers did to them. the detailed look at zombie or bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the honeynet project - a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as honey pots to attract hackers and gather information about how they work. while bot nets have been known about for some time estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely. to gather its information the german arm of the honeynet project created software tools to log what happened to the machines they put on the web. getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy. the longest time a honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only a few minutes. the shortest compromise time was only a few seconds. the research found that once compromised machines tend to report in to chat channels on irc servers and wait instructions from the malicious hacker behind the tools used to recruit the machine. many well-known vulnerabilities in the windows operating system were exploited by bot net controllers to find and take over target machines. especially coveted were home pcs sitting on broadband connections that are never turned off. the months of surveillance revealed that the different bot nets - which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines - are used for a variety of purposes. many are used as relays for spam to route unwanted adverts to pc users or as launch platforms for viruses. but the research team found that many are put to very different uses. during the monitoring period the team saw bot nets used to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks on separate targets. these attacks bombard websites with data in an attempt to overwhelm the target. using a bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against. one ddos attack was used by one firm to knock its competitors offline. other bot nets were used to abuse the google adsense program that rewards websites for displaying adverts from the search engine. some networks were used to abuse or manipulate online polls and games. criminals also seem to be starting to use bot nets for mass identity theft to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data. leveraging the power of several thousand bots it is viable to take down almost any website or network instantly said the researchers. even in unskilled hands it should be obvious that bot nets are a loaded and powerful weapon.
1250,turkey-iran mobile deal at risk turkey s investment in iran s mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by mps. iran s parliament voted by a large majority to cut turkcell s stake in a new mobile network from % to %. the move which was justified on national security grounds follows an earlier vote by mps to give themselves a veto over foreign investments. turkcell said the decision increases the risks attached to the project. although the company s statement said it would continue to monitor developments observers said they thought turkcell was set to pull out of the $ deal. the possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero said atinc ozkan analyst at finans investment in istanbul. if turkcell does back out mtn - the south african firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running. the company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if iran will award it the mobile deal. turkcell s mobile deal is the second turkish investment in iran to run into trouble. turkish-austrian consortium tav was chosen to build and run tehran s new imam khomeini international airport - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in may . in both cases the justification has been national security amid allegations that the turkish firms are too close to israel. the hardline posture taken by parliament which is dominated by religious conservatives could yet impact other inward investments.
1435,banker loses sexism claim a former executive at the london offices of merrill lynch has lost her £. ($.) sex discrimination case against the us investment bank. an employment tribunal dismissed stephanie villalba s allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay. but the -year-old won her claim of unfair dismissal resulting from her sacking in august . her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about £ a tiny fraction of what she asked for. the extent of damages will be assessed in the new year. the action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the uk - had been viewed as something of a test case. the tribunal decided that ms villalba had been unfairly dismissed because having been removed from a senior post she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation. ms villalba the former head of merrill s private client business in europe has made no decision on whether to appeal. a spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as very disappointing but pointed to some criticism of merrill s procedures within the lengthy judgement. the tribunal upheld ms villalba s claim of victimisation on certain specific issues including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract but said it found no evidence of laddish culture at the bank. we said from the start that this case was about performance not gender merrill said in a statement. ms villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman. merrill lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work. based in london s financial district ms villalba worked for merrill s global private client business in europe investing funds for some of merrill s most important customers. but in her employers told her she had no future after years with the company and she was made redundant. merrill lynch denied ms villalba s claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent. the firm had told the tribunal that ms villalba s division had been losing about $ a week. merrill said ms villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.
863,online commons to spark debate online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust says the institute of public policy research (ippr). existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services says the think-tank. although the net is becoming part of local and central government its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online commons for public debate. in its report is online community a policy tool the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities. adopting an ebay-type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection. what we are proposing is a civic commons will davies senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website. a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication - like a pre-legislation discussion. the idea of a civic commons was originally proposed by stephen coleman professor of e-democracy at the oxford internet institute. the ippr report points to informal small scale examples of such commons that already exist. it mentions good-practice public initiatives like the bbc s ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues. but he adds government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too. proposals for id cards for instance could also be widened to see if they could be used online. they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online. at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services said mr davies. but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities. the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each other s reputation by how they treat other members. using a similar mechanism trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built. this could mean a civic commons would work within a non-market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly-recognised rules. e-government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web. many online communities such as chatrooms mailing lists community portals message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues. with % of uk households now with access to the net the government suggests mr davies could act as an intermediary or middleman to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more cosmopolitan politics and public trust in policy. government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online. but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic non-market interactions said mr davies. there is a role for public bodies like the bbc libraries and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of cliques talking to each other he added. the paper is part of the ippr s digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain.
389,will tory tax cuts lift spirits michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts. should he win the next general election he has earmarked £ billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how. this was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters he believes will warm to. at its simplest it is saying: vote tory and you can have it both ways . not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services including health and education it would increase spending on defence police and pensions. and even after that was done it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax. all the money would come from its £ billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy waste and the civil service. of that £ billion would go on spending plans with £ billion to fill the black hole left they claim by gordon brown and the rest going in tax cuts. neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely. ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election. as the tory leader declared the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories. at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he said. it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts. the extension of that however was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters. and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street. labour needless to say claim his planned £ efficiency savings simply don t add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy. one of new labour s greatest successes before the historic election was to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy. so far that has not faced any real challenge but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances. meanwhile the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day. so mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor. and while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign it is likely - and the prime minister probably hopes - that the economy will be the deciding factor.
948,saudi ncci s shares soar shares in saudi arabia s national company for cooperative insurance (ncci) soared on their first day of trading in riyadh. they were trading % above the offer price on monday changing hands at riyals ($; £) after topping early in the day. demand for the insurer s debut shares was strong - times what was on sale. the listing was part of the country s plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand in the sector. deregulation is expected to boost demand for accident and damage cover. previously only ncci has been legally allowed to offer insurance products within saudi arabia. however the authorities have turned a blind eye to the many other firms selling insurance. saudi arabia now wants a fully functioning insurance industry and is introducing legislation that will clamp down on unauthorised companies. policy-makers also want to make having insurance more of a requirement but first have to take steps to boost public confidence in the system analysts said. as a result ncci is being developed as the industry s flagship firm - publicly-listed with audited accounts. saudi arabia sold million ncci shares or about % of the company s total capital last month. more than applicants got shares each for riyals apiece.

1631,elton plays paris charity concert sir elton john has performed at a special concert in paris to raise money for the victims of the asian tsunami. the british singer played to a -strong audience on sunday at the french capital s bastille opera house. the concert was also part of an attempt to bring a broader range of events to the famous venue. money raised will go to the fondation pour l enfance (foundation for childhood) which aims to rebuild a children s shelter in sri lanka. sir elton played hits from his vast back catalogue to a sell-out crowd which included former french president valery giscard d estaing and his wife anne-aymone. the veteran pop star played piano accompaniment throughout the concert which lasted for three hours without an interval. he told the crowd: throughout the years i ve done a lot of drugs and alcohol. it s true that i was a nightmare impossible. for the last years i ve been normal. now my drug is called david - a reference to david furnish his partner. the crowd who greeted each song with a standing ovation also included french singer charles aznavour and british ambassador sir john holmes. sir elton has also teamed up with phil collins to record a version of eric clapton s hit tears in heaven to raise money for the relief fund. a release date has yet to be set for the recording which was organised by sharon osbourne.
1791,choose hope over fear - kennedy voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election said charles kennedy. in his new year message the liberal democrat leader said labour and the conservatives were united in relying on fear and populist scares . he said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a poll. on the asian tsunami he said it had been very heartening to learn of the generosity being shown by britons. mr kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster which had dominated the christmas and new year period. at home he said many people were turning to the liberal democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties. the general election would be a three-party struggle as the conservative party fades away as a national force and the liberal democrats challenge labour in its heartlands he said. a clear division is emerging in british politics - the politics of fear versus the politics of hope. labour is counting on the politics of fear ratcheting up talk of threats crime and insecurity. while the conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the european menace he said. he said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties. it was already using detention without trial at belmarsh prison ignoring a recent law lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights he said. he also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials curbing of rights to protest increased stop and search powers and id card plans. he said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination. but at the same time an overmighty state is a dangerous one he said. his party instinctively understood the new liberal britain which is no longer a nation with one family structure and one colour he said. we are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality. our national institutions are changing too. we are no longer a nation of one church; we are a nation of many faiths. in our attitudes and the way we live our lives this is in many ways a liberal britain.
246,pupils to get anti-piracy lessons lessons on music piracy and copyright issues are to be taught to secondary school pupils in the uk. the lessons aimed at to -year-olds will introduce them to copyright - including the issues of downloading from the internet and the illegal copying of cds - and its role in protecting creativity. music piracy including illegally swapping music online costs the uk music industry millions every year and has been blamed for a decline in world-wide cd sales. british music rights (bmr) - which was formed to represent the interests of songwriters and composers - worked with education experts to put together a learning pack. songwriter guy chambers who has worked with stars including robbie williams has thrown his support behind the scheme. he said as well as educating children about music piracy it would also protect young people planning a career in the music industry from unscrupulous individuals. at a debate in london to launch the scheme chambers said: i think it is important that young people receive practical and engaging learning in schools. these lessons will give them an insight into how the creative industries work which will help them in possible future careers. the education pack which has already been requested by more than secondary schools is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry. it will also teach children about the importance of royalties and raises awareness of different careers in the music industry particularly in the digital age. henri yoxall general manager of british music rights told bbc news schools had been crying out for a resource to help them educate pupils about the issues. the scheme - which is an extension of bmr s respect the value of music campaign - is also being backed by singer-songwriters feargal sharkey lucie silvas and grammy award-winning composer david arnold. silvas said: i think it is so important that students gain an understanding of how the music industry works when they are at a young age. i wish i had been given an opportunity like this when i was at school. emma pike director general of british music rights said: we believe that copyright is an essential part of teaching music in schools. it is vital that the creatives of the future know how to turn their ideas into value. copyright education has always been important... creatives are facing more challenges and more opportunities from technological change. technology is allowing people to create music and distribute their music to the public in a whole host of new ways.

1733,borders - ulster ulster clung on for a morale-boosting celtic league win over bottom club borders at netherdale on friday night. a late try by borders substitute jonny weston had set up a dramatic finish but the scottish side could not complete the fightback. ulster had led - with tries from paul steinmetz and bryn cunningham. but the irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by charlie hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. calum macrae surrendered possession before centre steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. substitute joe pattison - who had come on for the injured gareth morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase. the speedy steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time giving adam larkin an easy conversion. ally warnock clawed back three points for borders but they were soon hit by another double-blow. first mark blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper andy ward. larkin again added the extras. even worse was to come for borders when larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break the second of which also led to kelly brown being sin-binned. the hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart however when warnock struck a penalty at the other end. and he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. ulster coach mark mccall said he was delighted to get the victory. borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time said mccall. in the first minutes we were edgy but in the second minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries. morton moffat macrae hore berthinussen warnock moore thomson ford douglas blair stewart gray brown mcentee. kay parr mcgee rennick weston millar pattison. cunningham maxwell bell steinmetz howe larkin campbell s. best shields moore frost mccullough ward feather n. best. brady mccormick longwell browne doak s. young bowe. phil fear (wru)
894,brown ally rejects budget spree chancellor gordon brown s closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a budget giveaway on march. ed balls ex-chief economic adviser to the treasury said there would be no spending spree before polling day. but mr balls a prospective labour mp said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. he was speaking as sir digby jones cbi director general warned mr brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes. mr balls who stepped down from his treasury post to stand as a labour candidate in the election had suggested that mr brown would meet his golden economic rule - with a margin to spare . he said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules. he also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected may election would not affect the labour party s chances of winning. expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in january. if the mpc (the bank of england s monetary policy committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and i m not predicting that they will - i do not believe that this will be a big election issue in britain for labour he told a parliamentary lunch. this is a big change in our political culture. during an interview with bbc radio s today programme mr balls said he was sure mr brown s budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. i don t think we ll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before he said. his assurances came after sir digby jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers skills. his message to the chancellor was: please don t give it away in any form of electioneering. sir digby added: i don t think he will. i have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. stability is the key word - british business needs boring stability more than anything. we would say to him don t increase your public spending don t give it away. but if you are going to anywhere just add something to the competitiveness of britain put it into skilling our people . that would be a good way to spend any excess. mr balls refused to say whether mr brown would remain as chancellor after the election amid speculation he will be offered the job of foreign secretary. i think that gordon brown wants to be part of the successful labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a conservative party that will take britain backwards mr balls told today. prime minister tony blair has yet to name the date of the election but most pundits are betting on may.

14,moya emotional after davis cup win carlos moya described spain s davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usa s challenge in seville. moya made up for missing spain s victory through injury by beating roddick - - (-) - (-) to give the hosts an unassailable - lead. i have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day said moya. all my energy has been focused on today. what i have lived today i do not think i will live again. spain s only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia when they beat australia. and moya nicknamed charly admitted: the davis cup is my dream and i was a bit nervous at the outset. some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way. it helps me reach my goals if i am obsessed. it s really incredible - to get the winning point is really something. spanish captain jordi arrese said: charly played a great game. it was his opportunity and he hasn t let us down. he had lost three times to roddick and this was his day to beat him. he had been waiting years to be in this position. spain s victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal who beat roddick in the opening singles. aged years and days the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup. what a great way to finish the year said nadal afterwards. us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better. obviously it s unrealistic to say that we re going to just start playing constantly on clay with the schedule. but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff said mcenroe. roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of seville s olympic stadium. it s just tough because i felt like i was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world said the american. i had my chances and just didn t convert them. the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. they came out took care of business and they beat us. it s as simple as that.
1782,clarke plans migrant point scheme anyone planning to move to the uk will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country home secretary charles clarke has said. he is proposing a points system similar to australia s but would avoid the quota system planned by the tories. mr clarke who will unveil his plans on monday said economic migration helped the uk but needed proper policing . the lib dems say they will look at his plans but tory liam fox said his party offered a clear choice on the issue. the conservative party co-chairman said the british electorate had a choice between a labour government that had done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit on immigration and a tory one that would impose quotas. the home secretary said by he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the uk to have their fingerprints taken to ensure we can know everybody who is in the country . speaking on bbc one s breakfast with frost he said economic migrants are of great value to this country but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a burden on society . he said: we will establish a system ... which looks at the skills talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country. the home secretary whose five-year blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on monday also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry. the issue of who does come into this country and whether they are entitled to be in this country who does settle here how we have border controls is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate he said. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: whilst it is good that labour has rejected the tory idea of quotas on asylum the jury is still out on the home office s ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system. mr howard has said britain should take its fair share of the world s genuine refugees . but he claims the current asylum system is being abused - and with it britain s generosity. trevor phillips chairman of the commission for racial equality called on mr clarke to denounce the suggestion britain s hospitality was being tested by immigration. tell that to the doctors in the nhs and the nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the health service means he said. ditto the teachers from south africa australia jamaica who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools. the refugee council said mr howard s proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the uk.

1034,jackson film absolute disaster a pr expert has told the michael jackson child abuse trial that the tv documentary at the heart of the case was an absolute disaster . ann kite told the court in the californian town of santa maria she was hired to crisis manage the fallout after the programme had aired in . jurors saw the film in which the pop star held hands with the alleged victim on tuesday. mr jackson denies charges of child abuse and false imprisonment. if convicted he could face up to years in prison. ms kite suggested jackson s associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accuser s family after the airing of martin bashir s film living with michael jackson. she told the court that in the aftermath of the broadcast a jackson lawyer had told her the boy s mother would be made to look like a crack whore . jackson s defence questioned ms kite s credibility pointing that she worked for the singer s team for less than a week before being fired and had never met or spoken to the star. ms kite said she received a phone call on february from a jackson associate marc schaffel who said the boy and his family had left the neverland ranch where they had been staying. ms kite told the court she had later asked jackson s lawyer david legrand what had happened. i said `don t make me believe that these people were hunted down like dogs and brought back to the ranch she said. ms kite began to work for mr jackson in february after the controversial film was televised in the us and europe. the documentary sparked a media storm and the subsequent investigation into mr jackson s relationship with the boy. in the film the singer said he did not see anything wrong with sharing a bed with a child. questioned by the prosecution ms kite said her plan had been to move media coverage of the star away from a focus on his human frailties to concentrate more on his musical genius. ms kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against mr jackson. the smoking gun website publication was beyond disaster ms kite said. correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up the previous case in front of the jury. the judge is studying whether the prosecution s first witness reporter martin bashir is in contempt of court. the defence protested after mr bashir who interviewed jackson for the tv documentary refused to answer nearly all their questions citing a california shield law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources. in the prosecution s opening statement on monday tom sneddon told the court that mr jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine in order to molest him. he said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy - who was at the time - and his younger brother pornography at his ranch.
339,russian ex-spy on hunger strike an ex-russian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near downing street. viktor makarov claims he has been betrayed by the british authorities who promised he would live like an average british citizen . but despite a £ settlement four years ago he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension. other ex-russian spies have been given civil service pensions. hunger strike is a weapon of last resort. it can work only with determination and of course the realisation of the righteousness of your case - without that it will not work mr makarov told the bbc s newsnight programme. since i came to this country two batches of promises have been made and broken one after the other. oleg gordievsky a senior kgb officer who became a secret agent for the british said he was very happy with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in . commenting on mr makarov s case he said: the british state is not a fat cow - it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week. but mr makarov s case has been backed by david kahn - a former yale historian and a leading expert on code-breaking who has confirmed his information was valuable to the western allies. i believe the government of the united kingdom which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities - took the information that victor makarov had wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold mr kahn said. mr makarov joined the kgb in russia as an idealistic year-old. one of his fellow pupils at intelligence school was vladimir putin. at kgb headquarters in moscow he was posted to the secret directorate - which decoded intercepted diplomatic traffic from the west. by the he had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant - and was privy to the thoughts of western powers. but he had became deeply disenchanted with the soviet regime - fuelled by its repression both at home and in poland. through his english teacher he made an approach to - and then began passing secrets to the british intelligence service. he spied for for two years before being betrayed by a friend and sent to perm - a soviet hard labour camp in the artic circle. within a week of his release in he made contact with the british authorities he d been spying for who arranged a meeting between him and an agent in latvia. he was given a false passport and he says promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average uk citizen. but after arriving in london years ago he feels this promise has not been fulfilled. after long periods of living in bedsits with deteriorating health four years ago he took legal action against the government - and settled for £ to buy a small house. but he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him. government sources told the bbc they had reached a final settlement with the former spy which he has been able to appeal to security and intelligence tribunals.
1998,cannabis hopes for drug firm a prescription cannabis drug made by uk biotech firm gw pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in canada. the drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (ms). a few weeks ago shares in gw pharma lost a third of their value after uk regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug s benefits. but now canadian authorities have said the sativex drug will be considered for approval. approximately people in canada have been diagnosed with ms and people are suffering from the condition in the uk. many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms. now gw pharma s sativex mouth spray could be legally available to ms sufferers in canada within the next few months. this will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world representing a landmark for gw pharma and for patients with ms. final approval in canada should now be little more than a formality analysts said and the company expects full approval for sativex early in . we are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from health canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for sativex in canada in the early part of said gw pharma executive chairman dr geoffrey guy. the uk government granted gw pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the english countryside. despite hopes of regulatory approval last year a series of delays has put back sativex s launch in the uk. the latest news sent shares in gw pharma up . or .% to ..
1868,hollywood to sue net film pirates the us movie industry has launched legal action to sue people who facilitate illegal film downloading. the motion picture association of america wants to stop people using the program bittorrent to swap movies. the industry is targeting people who run websites which provide information and internet links to movies which have been copied or filmed in cinemas. more than server operators have been targeted in the actions launched in the us and uk the mpaa added. the suits were filed against users of the file-sharing programs bittorrent edonkey and directconnect in the united states united kingdom france finland and the netherlands the mpaa said. bittorrent users can download movies by following a link to files which are found on websites called trackers. unlike most peer-to-peer programs bittorrent works by sharing a file which could be anything from a legitimate digital photo to a copied movie among multiple users at the same time. the movie industry hopes that suing the people who run the trackers will cut bittorrent users off from illegal movies at source. last month major film studios started legal action against individuals who were swapping films online. the growth in broadband has made it quicker for people to download movies and the industry fears that if it does not take action now it could suffer the same downturn as the music industry.
886,blair backs pre-election budget tony blair has backed chancellor gordon brown s pre-budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy. in a speech in edinburgh the prime minister said thursday s report reinforced stability and opportunity. and that would be central to labour s next election campaign planning for which was already well advanced. mr brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises. he told bbc radio s today programme: no politician should make the mistake that john major and his colleagues made in of saying no matter what the circumstances are they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing. that is not what politicians should do it would not be responsible to do. mr brown insisted his spending plans were affordable and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability which he said was the cornerstone of labour s programme. in a speech at edinburgh s napier university he said labour would publish over the next few months a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term . in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future much clearer than those in or . all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity security and stability for all mr blair said. in his pre-budget report mr brown surprised some city experts by forecasting uk growth at between % and .% for next year. many believe the figure is more likely to be under % - and fear tax rises or spending cuts saying tax receipts have been overestimated. carl emmerson from the institute for fiscal studies told bbc news: he thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will in fact be ok. we re not so sure. david page of investec securities said: his forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of £ is way too optimistic. it s going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets. conservative shadow chancellor oliver letwin said: i can t find a single economic forecaster from the imf to the institute of fiscal studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. in order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election. mr letwin accused the chancellor of using fancy statistics to hide public service failures. vincent cable for the liberal democrats called on mr brown to open up the government s books to the national audit office to see if he had met his golden rule . it is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending mr cable told mps.
1846,blind student hears in colour a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps. victor wong a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. to study space weather mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. a number of solutions were tried including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille. mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work. the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself mr wong told the bbc news website. for the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images. he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. in order to have an exact reference to the screen a pen and tablet device is used. the software then assigns one of piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally. if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it it wouldn t work that well. mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a colour memory makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears. the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images.
1794,robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales. robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the - loss as he contemplates sunday s set-to with france at twickenham. lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems. and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat. olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour. the bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against france with either tait or noon dropping out. tait given little opportunity to shine in attack received praise from robinson afterwards even if the coach admitted cardiff was an unforgiving place for the teenage prodigy. robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line after just one outing a player he regards as central to england s future. tait himself at least outwardly appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular. i want more of that definitely he said. hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we ll have to look at the video and wait and see. we were playing on our own for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. i thought we defended reasonably well but we ve just got to pick it up for france. his newcastle team-mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test. he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build-up to wales try conceded a penalty at the breakdown was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson s cross-kick into touch all inside the first quarter. his contribution improved in the second half but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. up front the line-out remains fallible despite a superb performance from chris jones whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody. it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards with andy hazell likely to make way. lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground.
1009,cardinal criticises iraq war cost billions of pounds spent on conflict in iraq and in the middle east should have been used to reduce poverty cardinal cormac murphy-o connor has said. the head of the catholic church in england and wales made the comments on bbc radio and will re-iterate his stance in his christmas midnight mass. the cardinal used a christmas message to denounce the war in iraq as a terrible waste of money. he and the archbishop of canterbury have both spoken out about the war. speaking on bbc radio s thought for the day slot he criticised the fact that billions have been spent on war instead of being used to bring people out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease . the cardinal said should be the year for campaigning to make history poverty . he added: if the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears. the cardinal will touch on this theme again on friday night when he will tell the congregation of at westminster cathedral that peace is worth always striving for . how is it that peace has not arrived the cardinal will ask. how is it that there is war in iraq violence in the holy land and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace how can one wish a happy christmas for our fellow christians in iraq or in the holy land or those who suffer in africa unless you and i in whatever way is open to us say and do what makes for peace both the cardinal and archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in iraq before the war started. dr williams has since criticised the government over its case for war saying the failure to find weapons of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system. on friday the cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace. it is possible it is real it is worth always striving for because of the promise of our saviour he will say. i also wish you peace in your homes because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the homes of the community. a spokesman said downing street had no comment to make. but prime minister tony blair has said he will put africa at the top of the agenda when britain chairs the summit next year.

2205,dance music not dead says fatboy dj norman cook - aka fatboy slim - has said that dance music is not dead but has admitted it is currently going through a fallow patch . the commercial failure of the latest albums by britain s two biggest dance acts - fatboy slim s palookaville and the prodigy s always outnumbered never outgunned - has been coupled with the closure of many superclubs and the folding of three dance music magazines. last month the brit awards announced they would no longer be awarding a best dance act prize with the brits committee announcing that dance music is no longer where it s happening in music. these developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre. cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album halfway between the gutter and the stars but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over. every week when i was making the album i was reading articles about the demise of dance music - and obviously that affects you somewhat he told bbc world service s the ticket programme. i personally don t believe it s either dead or going to die but it s going through a bit of a fallow patch. so i think consciously or subconsciously reading every week that dance music was dead i would think right scrub that track then . although his album sales in the uk are down - palookaville stayed in the uk top for just three weeks - cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties. and event on brighton sea front in attracted people while a later one in rio achieved a crowd of . the dvd of the rio set was the biggest seller of that year. with a crowd that big if the weather s nice the atmosphere before i even go is so good that about halfway through the first record i think i ve got them cook said. i m always really really nervous before the big ones - they had to give me valium before rio because two hours before i was literally just pacing the floor. for some reason especially now i ve got a reputation for it the atmosphere and the joie de vivre that s already going on means all i have to do is play up records. he promised more such parties in more locations around the world - despite problems after the brighton event which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt. one man also died of a heart attack and a woman fell to her death during the free party. we re having to widen our horizons from just beaches because there s landlocked countries that want to get involved cook said. we re doing rio at the carnival at the maracana and sao paolo - our new gig is famous football stadiums. the dj admitted however that his massive worldwide success had a downside with intense media interest in his personal life. in particular he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break-up of his marriage to radio one presenter zoe ball after she was linked with dj dan peppe. the tabloid thing has been difficult at times cook said. especially the me-and-zoe-gate - it s quite scary. he said that he had been determined that what had happened with ball did not affect the album. at first i was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldn t think i was depressed he explained. then i thought that s not right . and he highlighted a bizarre coincidence - that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended. i said to zoe i did this track called my masochistic baby went and left me do you mind if it s on the album he recalled. she said yeah it s hilarious because your masochistic baby did leave you . cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on - where paul mccartney is a neighbour. it s almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs cook explained. if there s a pap at the end of the road everyone knocks on each other s doors - paul comes round and we warn him because we don t know who they re after.

1305,parry relishes anfield challenge bbc sport reflects on the future for liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive rick parry. chief executive parry is the man at the helm as liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history. parry has to deliver a new -seat stadium in stanley park by amid claims of costs spiralling above £. he is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore liverpool to their place at european football s top table. but it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with parry who has forged a reputation as one of football s most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling premier league. liverpool have not won the championship since a fact that causes deep discomfort inside anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of chelsea manchester united and arsenal. throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain steven gerrard and you can see parry is a man with a lot on his plate. but in the comfort of a conference room deep inside liverpool s heartbeat - the kop end - parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead. he only dodged one question - when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting liverpool a polite smile deflected the inquiry. but to his credit he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that liverpool still mean business. by business he means becoming title challengers again and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to liverpool is parry s mission. parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager rafael benitez. and his enthusiasm for the spaniard s personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold. benitez s early work has given parry renewed optimism about the years ahead. but it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations. this will not come as news to parry a lifelong liverpool supporter but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting... captain gerrard is central to liverpool s plans and parry s insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent. as ever the player will have the final say and parry acknowledges that but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for liverpool and gerrard to flourish. in terms of the search for new investment hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in march . thailand prime minister thaksin shiniwatra came and went while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan steve morgan. morgan had a succession of bids rejected having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium. bbc sport understands morgan is still ready and willing to invest in liverpool and parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere. morgan however has had no formal contact with liverpool or their advisors since last december blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his £ offer. he was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others so any new approach would now have to come from liverpool. morgan will certainly not be making another call. so speculation continues about the new benefactor with trails leading to the middle east and america but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from anfield. parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to liverpool s future but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea. he is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium. parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up but there has been a vital new development in north london that has re-shaped liverpool s thinking. liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of arsenal s stunning £ deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton has changed the landscape. parry labelled the deal an eye-opener and admits liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities. he knows some traditionalist liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just anfield but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain. i would take £ if we had no investment but if we did keep him. as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really £ for gerrard i don t care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard s quality. through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do. critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard. ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. i am hoping he doesn t walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash. £ realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it. i would however be happy with gerrard s transfer for any fee over £. parry s statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. upping the ante is another smart move by parry. i would keep gerrard. no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed. the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. clearly if he isn t then we would be foolish not to sell. the worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football.

1918,uk tv channel rapped for csi ad tv channel five has been criticised for sending offensive and threatening advertising material to viewers for a new show about murder scene scientists. five mailed thousands of fake dossiers including photos of murder victims and an e-mail suggesting the recipient was being stalked by a serial killer. following complaints the advertising standards authority contacted five to cease promotion of crime show csi:ny. five admitted it had sent out promotion packs but had now stopped. the promotion material was sent in brown envelope of the type used by investigators in the series a spin-off from the highly successful csi: crime scene investigation series which also runs on five. the pack also features pictures of forensic evidence from a crime scene and a wanted poster which did have a csi:ny logo printed in large at the bottom. five said it had received complaints but that it had been surprised at the reaction because it was obvious this material is promoting a drama . a five spokesman said: in light of the efforts we have made to make the nature of the contents so transparent we are surprised a very small minority of recipients have mistaken it as anything else. everyone who was sent this promotion has expressed an interest in receiving details about this particular genre of programming on various websites. we have also received emails and calls from recipients praising the originality and imagination of the campaign.
342,web photo storage market hots up an increasing number of firms are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections. digital cameras were the hot gadget of christmas and worldwide sales of the cameras totalled $ last year. many people s hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular. search firms such as google are also offering more complex tools for managing personal photo libraries. photo giants such as kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections lets users edit pictures online and provides print-ordering services. some services such as kodak s ofoto and snapfish offer unlimited storage space but they do require users to buy some prints online. other sites such as pixagogo charge a monthly fee. marcus hawkins editor of digital camera magazine said: as file sizes of pictures increase storage becomes a problem. people are using their hard drives backing up on cd and dvd and now they are using online storage solutions. they are a place to store pictures to share their pictures with families and friends and they can print out their photos. while many of the services are aimed at the amateur and casual digital photographer other websites are geared up for enthusiasts who want to share tips and information. photosig is an online community of photographers who can critique each other s work. on tuesday google released free software for organising and finding digital photos stored on a computer s hard drive. the tool called picasa automatically detects photos as they are added to a pc - whether sent via e-mail or transferred from a digital camera. the software includes tools for restoring colour and removing red eye as well as sharpening images. photos can then be uploaded to sites such as ofoto. many people use the sites to edit and improve their favourite photographs before ordering prints. mr hawkins added: the growth area is that you can order your prints online. friends and family can also access pictures you want them to see and they can print them out too. rather than just a place to dump your pictures it s about sharing them. the vast majority of pictures remain on a pc s hard drive which is why search tools such as those offered by google become increasingly important. but some historians and archivists are concerned that the need for perfect pictures will mean that those poor quality prints which offered a tantilising glimpse of the past may disappear forever. it s one thing taking pictures it s another finding them said mr hawkins. but this is the same problem that has always existed - how many of us have photos in wallets tucked away somewhere

1886,thompson says gerrard should stay liverpool legend phil thompson has pleaded with steve gerrard to reject any overtures from chelsea. the ex-reds assistant boss also warned that any honours won at chelsea would be cheapened by the bid to buy success. he told bbc radio five live: liverpool would think about any bid made but it will all be down to steve in the end. but it wouldn t have that same sweet feeling at chelsea where it s all money-orientated and about simply buying the best. thompson reacted sharply to some liverpool supporters who criticised gerrard s performance in the carling cup final against chelsea. a number of fans questioned gerrard s commitment and sarcastically branded his own goal in liverpool s - defeat as his first goal for chelsea. thompson added: i heard those comments from so-called supporters and they were diabolical absolutely outrageous. stevie carried the club last year and this year. he s always put liverpool first. thompson who savoured seven title-winning seasons and two european cup triumphs during his anfield playing career is confident that the lure of champions league football will keep gerrard at anfield. i hope champions league football will beckon for liverpool - either as winners or as finishing fourth in the premiership - and he will commit himself. there has been a lot of soul-searching the way things have gone lately. i hope he s hardening to the fact he will have big decisions to make but i hope it is to the benefit of steven gerrard and i hope it is worthwhile for liverpool.
682,europe blames us over weak dollar european leaders have openly blamed the us for the sharp rise in the value of the euro. us officials were talking up the dollar they said but failing to take action to back up their words. meeting in brussels finance ministers of the eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports. the dollar is within touching distance of an all-time low reached earlier in november. at gmt on tuesday the dollar was up slightly at just above $. to the euro and buying . yen in tokyo. it rallied briefly on monday amid signs that oil prices are easing. but analysts said the respite was likely to be only temporary. the european ministers comments said junya tanase of jpmorgan chase bank in tokyo were generally too weak to produce a market reaction . still by the standards of diplomacy the european ministers were forthright. nicolas sarkozy of france said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit europe s economies by eating into their exports. we are concerned about these developments which are destabilising and which are linked to the accumulation of deficits by our american friends he said. the comments come a day after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was in america s interest . but that was not enough for mr sarkozy. if the americans were to change their policy it s up to them to say so he said. and the european union s monetary affairs commissioner made it clear that action was necessary. i fully welcome the words of mr snow said joaquin almunia but we will need to see decisions adopted in that direction. if the imbalances in the us economy are not adjusted in the future the decision in the market will be as in the past weeks. economists point out that whatever europe says in the short term a weaker dollar is a boon to president george w bush s administration. not only does it boost us exports but it also makes the budget deficit easier to fund. on the other hand slower european exports would mean slower eu growth - potentially reducing the demand for us goods.
530,labour s core support takes stock tony blair has told labour supporters he s back and still hungry for the job of prime minister - but does that sum up the mood at the party s spring conference in gateshead the electorate are keener on the government than some labour party members is the dry assessment of graham lane leader of the labour group on newham council. the problem according to mr lane is not continuing divisions over iraq foundation hospitals or tuition fees or even voter apathy but mr blair himself. i have a new slogan. vote blair get brown. that s what i am telling people on the doorstep. don t worry he will be gone soon. his friend saxon spence leader of devon county labour group lays the blame for any lack of campaigning zeal on one issue above all others. you cannot underestimate the impact of the war in iraq. we lost people from our local party who had some key roles. but the two friends were fired up by gordon brown s speech on saturday with its appeal to core labour values on social justice health and education. there was real passion. i think we have all felt a little jaded but it reminded us why we joined the party in the first place said mrs spence. if he hadn t have walked off the stage they would still be clapping added mr lane. but for every brownite at the spring conference there was an equally ardent fan of mr blair. stephen douglas from wales said after the pm s speech on sunday: i think it was a bit of a turning point given the roasting he has had on some issues. the guy still has it. tony martin of burnley said: he is the first leader who has won us two terms. this bloke has delivered for us. malcolm shipley of shipley said it was as if he is coming round to the right approach again . katrina bull a prospective parliamentary candidate said mr blair had shown he could rouse the party s grassroots: i think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with tony the way we have today we will have no problem with turnout. she had just emerged from a q&a session in which mr blair - tieless and supremely at ease - answered questions posed via the party s website. a party of councillors from nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with mr blair s leadership - and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever. iraq they insisted would not be a factor for most voters. the biggest problem we have got at the moment is that we keep getting all these polls saying we are going to run away with the election. it might sound great but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and i think that is the greater problem than iraq said nottingham city councillor brian parbutt. and even mr blair s most vocal critics seemed to agree on one thing - he is a master of the sort of glossy high-profile campaigning that has become labour s hallmark epitomised by friday s whistle-stop tour of marginal seats. a group of shop stewards from the swan hunter shipyard who said they were facing redundancy could barely suppress their anger at mr blair s failure to as they saw it shake off his tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the north east. they were also scathing about the alleged benefits of showpiece projects such as conference venue sage centre heralded by john prescott and others this weekend as a symbol of labour s success in urban regeneration. it is no good having the sage or baltic if you haven t got the money for the entrance fee said terry telford. but when asked about mr blair s bravura performance on friday the men agreed he was brilliant . and they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the labour message come election time. if you are not fired up about the election then what s the point there is no complacency as far as i can see in the labour party. we are fired up. we are up for this election said richie porterhouse. mr telford agreed but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked what has labour done for the north east i have had doors slammed in my face he said. every activist i spoke to said they were proud of what they believed labour had achieved in their local communities - the new hospitals and schools the better life chances for young people. the problem they faced they said was converting this local feelgood factor into votes. but they could at least rely on one secret weapon as one activist put it - tory leader michael howard.

1661,drink remark acts as diversion the first minister s statement that it was okay to get drunk once in a while has diverted attention from the real issues it has been claimed. jack law chief executive of alcohol focus scotland said jack mcconnell s comment was ill-advised . the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland s binge drinking problems mr law said. scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been obscured by the remark. mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. the one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk . mr macdonell political editor of the scotsman said: i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. if you come out with something like this saying that by all means get drunk then you will be pilloried for it. however he added that perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage . mr macdonell said: i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. i understand why but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured. mr law from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland believed damage had been done to scotland s fight against binge drinking. he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. mr law added: i think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland. we don t want to preach to young people but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness. he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were off the mark they were bound to come back and bite him . he added: here mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. i think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark. the scottish national party s holyrood leader nicola sturgeon wrote to mr mcconnell on tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his ill-judged comment and withdraw it immediately. in a furious response the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. he told ms sturgeon: it is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that i should encourage young people to get drunk . that is completely untrue. perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position undermine the convener of education at highland council and insult the intelligence of the young people i spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.

565,howard attacks pay later budget tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown s budget as vote now pay later spending plans. the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole mr howard said. everyone could see the chancellor s sweeteners but these hid tax rises for hard working families he said. labour s faltering election campaign would not be helped by the package of measures mr howard added. mr brown s budget was not about what was good for the country but all about the interests of the labour party the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging millions of people in to the net to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax. we can all see the sweeteners but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if labour wins. he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced. their only answer is to tax to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later. mr brown liked to rattle off magical balances conjured out of thin air in a bid to convince people there was no black hole in the nation s finances the tory leader said. this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers he said. you now propose to borrow over the next six years no less than £ billion; so much for prudence. the chancellor s forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister s forecasts of weapons of mass destruction. mr brown s council tax rebate for pensioners was £ less than what the tories were offering mr howard said. there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. people would face a clear choice at the election either more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives he said. that s the battleground of this election. that s what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on he concluded to loud tory cheering.

944,mourinho expects fight to finish chelsea manager jose mourinho expects the champions league clash with barcelona to be a fight to the finish. mourinho is relishing the first leg of the tie against his former club in the last in the nou camp. he said: i wouldn t be surprised if nothing had been decided by the last minute of the return leg and the match had to go into extra time. i have to defend what is mine and the champions league is mine at the moment. i m the last manager to have won it. mourinho never coached barcelona assisting both sir bobby robson and louis van gaal. but he is not envious insisting: i don t have to be jealous about barcelona because they have years of history and have won the european cup once. i have been managing for five years and i have the same amount of champions league trophies to my name. barcelona star ronaldinho admitted: i think that it is going to be a difficult match for us because chelsea have a good team full of big stars. i have seen chelsea a few times on television tactically they are very good and they are very strong on the counter-attack. they pressure very well and keep possession of the ball so it will be important that we play our own game. i believe they are the two strongest teams in europe. nevertheless barcelona are accustomed to playing big games at the nou camp where they have to face the likes of real madrid each season. it is a special game the atmosphere in the city changes there are lots of journalists but inside the dressing room there is not a lot of difference ronaldinho added. we are only thinking of winning the match with all respect to the opposition.
1024,labour attacked on howard poster labour has been accused of using anti-semitic images in posters which critics claim depict tory leader michael howard as fagin. the poster shows mr howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch saying: i can spend the same money twice. the image prompted concern from the editor of the jewish chronicle but labour insists it is simply anti-tory. labour later took the image off its website saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members. the party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin with a blackboard reading: += . the hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the dickens character fagin in the stage version of the musical oliver! there was controversy over another poster choice offered to labour members. it showed mr howard and mr letwin - who are both jewish - as flying pigs. mr howard did not comment on the anti-semitism claims when asked about the poster on monday. instead he pointed to how tony blair had in complained about personalised abusive campaigning . mr howard told greater manchester radio: it is such a pity that mr blair doesn t practise what he preaches. jewish chronicle editor ned temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from jewish chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image. shylock and fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries-old prejudice he told bbc radio s world at one. whatever the idea is i think it s a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning. mr temko said he blamed cock-up not conspiracy saying he did not detect inherent anti-semitism in any of the parties election campaigns. the poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to labour members who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. labour mp louise ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-semitic when they only challenged tory economic policies. labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said the poster had been misunderstood. the image simply portrayed mr howard as a hypnotist he argued. concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but i would emphasise that if you see the posters the common theme... is that the tories are trying to con you. a labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party s website was not affected by the row. this has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss he said. but a conservative spokeswoman said: this poster campaign - which was offensive to many people - was a big misjudgement by labour s campaign team.

1876,blair joins school sailing trip the prime minister has donned a life jacket and joined school children in a sailing dinghy as he sought to sell his party s education policies. tony blair sailed across the lake in bromsgrove worcestershire while on a visit with education secretary ruth kelly to back school outings. mr blair later stressed labour s election pledge to focus on education when he met parents in the area. the conservatives and lib dems both say his pledges are worthless . all the parties are stepping up campaigning ahead of a general election widely expected to be held on may. mr blair looking a little windswept joined two girls from st egwin s middle school in evesham and an instructor for a trip in the wayfarer dinghy closely followed by a boat full of photographers. afterwards he said outdoor activities were beneficial for children but accepted that lots of teachers now worried about taking part for fear of being sued if something went wrong. what we re doing is introducing some simple guidelines so if teachers follow those they are not going to be at risk of legal action mr blair said. when you are doing these types of activities you ve got to exercise some common sense there obviously. you can t have a situation where parents or teachers end up being worried that they re going to be subject to all sorts of legal action if they take children sailing or doing outdoor activity that is actually good for the kids and good for their health and their character. the pledge on education - your child achieving more - was one of six election pledges unveiled by mr blair last week. if it wins a third term in the general election expected this year labour is committed to giving parents more choice between schools; allowing all secondary schools to take on specialist status; opening city academies and creating more sixth-form places. it aims to improve discipline in schools by adopting a zero tolerance approach to disruption of classes and introducing fixed penalty notices for truants. labour also plans to give head teachers at groups of local schools control over funding for units to handle disruptive pupils. parents and teachers who met mr blair on tuesday were invited to the informal discussion after writing to their mps to raise concerns about education. it is the latest in a series of events designed to show the prime minister is speaking directly to voters in the run-up to the election - and that he has not lost touch. for the conservatives shadow education secretary tim collins said: mr blair& government is all talk. he must be judged on what he has done in two terms not what he mendaciously claims he would do in a third. that judgment will be damning. the liberal democrats are promising to cut class sizes for the youngest children and ensure all children are taught by a qualified teacher in each subject.

785,fresh hope after argentine crisis three years after argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis there is fresh hope. the country s economy is set to grow about % this year after seeing % growth last year a sharp turnaround from when output fell %. the unemployment rate is improving too: it is set to slip below % by the end of the year down from % in may . true problems remain but the overall picture is one of vast improvement. even the international monetary fund (imf) admits this. the argentine authorities are proud should be proud of the strong performance of the economy thomas dawson an imf director said earlier this month. argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors. the debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which at least initially was made worse by the government s decisions. pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country s massive debts. in response angry crowds of ordinary argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police. two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month. argentina was on the brink of collapse. the fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso s decade-long peg to the us dollar in february . the subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people s life savings disappear. scathes of companies went bust. three years ago every sector [of the economy] was hit by the crisis said entrepreneur drayton valentine. it really was dire. but since then the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within brazil. agriculture and tourism are helping said entrepreneur drayton valentine. mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina was fortunate: at the time of the crisis his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad. but now he is using his money to help with the start-up a trading company. he explained that initially his firm is going to export building materials to spain and united states. then he would like to diversify to other areas depending on the market. locally there is a sense of recovery many companies are exporting now he said noting that a lot of firms which were closed during the crisis are re-opening. but not all that shines is gold. argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of . president nestor kirchner s administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors but with the debts nominal value standing at around $ it is not proving easy. debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate. argentina s current offer implies that the creditors would get just cents for each dollar they are owed according to the creditors. understandably they want more and until they do both they and others are loath to continue lending. for president kirchner this proves a hopeless challenge. real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay observed jack boorman adviser to imf s managing director rodrigo rato. everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached he said. the cost is enormous and continues to be paid and will not be reversed by any restructuring. with the international negotiations being troubled it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well. this is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits. the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina said carlos baez silva president of aara an association that represents bank account and bond holders. few people have recovered more than about half their savings mr baez silva estimated pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe. a lot of them invested in good faith he said. the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments. the affair has made mr baez silva disillusioned with the country s legal system. on occasion the supreme court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents he says insisting that the system cannot be trusted. people have to deposit their money in the banks not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses. mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina agreed. if i have to save pesos [the local currency] there is not much problem but i will think twice before i deposit dollars in a bank .

2005,police urge pub closure power new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently police chiefs have told mps. association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current -hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. mr fox s comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock. he rejected critics calls for the law change to be delayed. instead the new licensing act could help reduce drunken disorder - but only if it was properly planned he argued. acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the commons home affairs select committee. after the meeting mr fox said being able to close premises for only hours did not necessarily make an impact. if it s . on a saturday morning and you close for hours there s not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn t open on sunday anyway. this is about getting through to the management that they can t run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions. under acpo s proposal the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority. the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs - but only for -hour periods. mr fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself. it s making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse and the strategic planning process has been less than useless he said. mr fox said the new laws due to start being phased in next month could help if food outlets public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers. staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there if the premises are properly managed and people aren t being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street he said. we have the problem from to in any event. we have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this. acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs. home secretary charles clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing. the licensing changes have sparked concern among some mps councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems. culture secretary tessa jowell on tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes. it was the status quo not the new laws which were causing current binge drinking problems she told bbc two s newsnight. leaked documents have suggested ex-home secretary david blunkett branded new opening hours as a leap in the dark . but ms jowell insisted his concerns had been met. the police s job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time she added.
571,tories urge change at the top tory delegates are gathering for what is expected to be their last conference before the general election declaring britain needs a change at the top . the party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and labour. tory co-chairman liam fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising tony blair s record in government. labour s rule has been characterised by lost trust and failure to deliver he told the brighton conference. he also attacked the government s failure to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. a tory government would sort out the shambles of immigration put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools he said. dr fox also underlined tory promises to cut tax by £. bbc political correspondent shaun ley says opinion polls suggest the tories still lag some way behind labour on the issues of health education and the economy. conservative leader michael howard who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday will address them in a lunchtime speech. his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the party s opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament. the bill was finally passed on friday evening after more than hours of debate. mr howard is likely to defend his party s handling of the bill which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blair s promise that mps would be able to review it within a year.
616,uk interest rates held at .% the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at .% in a widely-predicted move. rates went up five times from november - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since august. recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending as well as in mortgage approvals. and retail sales disappointed over christmas with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence. rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers optimism causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium. the brc said britain s retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade. today s no change decision is correct said david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce (bcc). but if there are clear signs that the economy slows the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. dismal reports from the retail trade about christmas sales are worrying if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending. mr frost added: the housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. it is widely accepted that if house prices start falling more sharply the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably. cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had slowed in recent months in response to rate rises but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity he said. interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time. on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front as the office for national (ons) statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november - for the fifth month in the past six. the ons said manufacturing output dropped .% in november matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists expectations of a .% rise. manufacturers organisation the eef said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. it also said there was evidence that manufacturers confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain. so far the evidence suggests that last year s rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing said eef chief economist steve radley. however should the business outlook start to deteriorate the bank should stand ready to cut rates. some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to % before that happens. the bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at % a year - if economic conditions worsen.

down and then has to save a break point after a tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence. but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set. roddick s serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set. three times nadal forces a break point and three times the world number two hangs in. and roddick s grit pays off as he manages to hold. roddick still looks a bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with a break point which nadal saves with a good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold. there is a disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd. the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is. one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down. roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with a service winner. the game passes the two-hour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set. now roddick has to defend a break point and he produces a characteristic ace to save it. it is immediately followed by another and he holds with a little dinked half-volley winner. roddick is looking a little leaden-footed but does carve out a break point for himself. but he plays it poorly and nadal avoids the danger. roddick has gone off the boil and again struggles. he fails to get down properly for a low forehand volley and gives nadal three break points. the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with a double fault and the rubber is level. nadal edges towards taking the second set with a comfortable hold. two good serves put roddick - up but he then makes a couple of errors to find himself - down. he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold. roddick s level has dropped while nadal is on a hot streak. the spaniard includes a superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping a point. roddick double-faults twice and nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered powering a passing winner past roddick. nadal wins another tight game. neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set. nadal puts the american under pressure and roddick saves a break point with a superb stop volley before going on to hold. nadal puts the disappointment of losing the first-set tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second. roddick double-faults to concede the first mini-break and then nadal loops a crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak. he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points. but roddick saves them and then earns one himself. nadal comes up with a down-the-line winner but then nets tamely on roddick s next set point. nadal s nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak. both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide. a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points. the point of the match so far involves roddick s slam-dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally. on the very next point nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud. but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game. nadal outplays roddick to reach - but the american fights back to - before nadal s powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game. the crowd are getting very involved cheering between roddick s first and second serves. but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set. nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve. the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord. roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure. a well-placed serve is unreturnable and roddick holds. a powerful ace down the middle gives nadal a simple love service game - the first time he has held serve so far in the match. if roddick didn t know before he knows now that he is in a real contest. another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof. he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows. four of the first five games have seen a break of serve. despite the disappointment of losing his serve roddick is not phased and storms into a - lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close line-call. nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net. roddick s advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately. a fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve nadal pumps his fist in celebration. the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadal s serve from the start. nadal s drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break. after moya s win in the opening rubber a raucous seville crowd is buoyed by nadal s impressive start which sees him race into a - lead. however roddick fights back to hold his serve.
498,backs africa debt relief plan finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to % of the debts of some of the world s poorest countries. uk chancellor gordon brown said the london meeting of the world s seven richest nations would be remembered as the % debt relief summit . some countries could benefit after a case-by-case review by bodies including the world bank and the imf he said. but the us says it cannot support mr brown s international finance facility to boost aid to developing countries. bbc correspondents said the meeting had produced some movement towards the uk s ambitions but much work was needed. mr brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to % multilateral debt relief - the vast bulk of money owed by the poorest countries. we could be at the beginning of the final stage of the process where the debts that were owed by the poorest countries built up over or years debts that are simply unpayable in the real world are finally taken care of he said. he added: it is the richest countries hearing the voices of the poor. but he said they would insist on government reforms and the need for transparency tackling corruption and openness from both the poorest and richest nations. bbc correspondent patrick bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice. oxfam senior policy adviser max lawson welcomed the statement and said ministers had passed the first hurdle of . but he added: they need to move quickly to turn their proposals into real change for the world s poorest. two million children will die needlessly between now and the next meeting in april. if rich countries are going to keep their promises to tackle obscene poverty they need deliver - and deliver quickly. talks are continuing on how to finance increased overseas development assistance. the international monetary fund (imf) is to look at a proposal to use its gold supplies to help the debt relief effort when it meets in april. mr brown said ministers had agreed to defer debt interest payments and repayments for some countries affected by the tsunami until the end of . but uk plans for an international finance facility (iff) to help deal with debt in the developing world have not been agreed. mr brown wanted to provide $ (£.) a year over a decade using backing so the money could be borrowed up front on financial markets. it is a key element of his proposals for a modern version of the marshall plan which brought us aid to rebuild europe after world war ii for the developing world. mr brown said it was winning support every day and said a programme had been agreed to draw up more details in time for the summit in july. but us treasury under-secretary john taylor said the us could not support the iff because of its legislative process . the us is completely committed to poverty reduction and providing financing to do that he said. but this particular mechanism does not work for the united states. it works for other countries and that is fine. earlier he told bbc radio s today programme the us had increased support for africa in the past four years from $. per year to $. per year. but south africa finance minister trevor manuel told the bbc s talking point programme what was needed was one approach with all wealthy nations on board. he said much of the money pledged by the us had not yet been dispensed. the uk has made poverty in the poorest nations a key theme for its presidency of the group of eight () which comprises the and russia. the countries will meet at gleneagles in scotland. at a dinner on friday night former south african president nelson mandela backed mr brown s plan when he urged the finance chiefs to write-off african debt and provide an extra $ (£.) a year in aid for the next decade. talks also centred on the impact of the rising economies of china and india the us budget and trade deficits how the us europe and japan can act to boost global economic growth and hiv/aids. ministers called for more flexibility in international exchange rates and said excess volatility would impede economic growth. representatives from china india russia south africa and brazil were invited to attend some of the sessions. a summit is set to take place in july.
1604,kilroy launches veritas party ex-bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy-silk said he wanted to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party. mr kilroy-silk who recently quit the uk independence party said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration. he told a london news conference that veritas - latin for truth - would avoid the old parties lies and spin . ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk. mr kilroy-silk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks. labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining an already crowded field on the right of british politics . on thursday mr kilroy-silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon s ashfield seat. he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip s two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader. ukip s chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. mr kilroy-silk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june s european elections. while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said. i will be standing at the next general election. i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in. and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight. mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy-silk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party. a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly. the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down. its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk. he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the [european] election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said. ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead. veritas it s the bnp in an expensive suit! it s all well and good robert kilroy-silk claiming that veritas is a party that doesn t believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the two-horse race trend. in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for his anti-islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television. i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many. it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue. in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy -silk opposing geoff hoon!! good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done. let s hope kilroy-silk ukip and the euro-sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe. we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europe leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go not running away from it. all mouth and trousers. a clown. trouble is any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term. whatever kilroy-silk and ukip do none of their anti-european policies have any relevance outside middle england. this new party might gain support from right-wing england but will have little impact in wales or scotland. hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue. england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better we can t rely on the usa forever! at last an impetus for increasing the likely % turn out for the election. the electorate is disillusioned with british politics. kilroy has one agenda - the uk - and i ll be voting for him. both ukip and rk-s are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind. the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people s bickering that who in the overall scheme of things really cares about their petty tiff many people believe you kilroy. you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility. the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating. one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls. i ve always thought that kilroy-silk was a self-publicising egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion. brilliant about time this country had a plausible party! having seen the recent bbc documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy-silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people. hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action. fantastic news. pro-europeans now have far less to worry about from the right. the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid- and the extreme anti-europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local european and general elections. robert kilroy-silk s ego and vanity are his own (and his supporters ) worst enemy. as a euro-enthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroy-silk s behaviour. he took a party that was just building up a head of steam and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d etat he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two. the closer to straight-down-the-middle the better as far as i am concerned but in any eventuality the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other. if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose we d have ballot papers a mile long! you ve got to hand it to kilroy-silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief. whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership and like him i am also leaving ukip. i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means. the eu s comments last week about michael howard s plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states. the sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro-sceptic kilroy-silk has used a latin name for his new party rather than a good old british name is this indicative of the man - contradictory vain and pompous i think mr kilroy-silk has got a very good point. british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians. they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power. as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped. if mr kilroy-silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote. honestly who really cares man with tan leaves party with no plan to set up party with no idea. as one of kilroy-silk s east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity. i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament. ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him. someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukip s democratic nature. kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not. he tried to make it work but they didn t seem to want to grow up. he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media. this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy. good luck to the man i say. oh please! this is an amusing irrelevance. there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive eurosceptic argument. they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed more democratic more dynamic europe union. future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness. the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open honest and straight. what other politician can claim this. i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like. i shall be voting for him. the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy-silk but for the ukip. kilroy-silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip s party list. he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament. i wouldn t write off kilroy-silk. while he s a clown and a one man band at the moment he s a populist and that s always dangerous.the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters that seems to be one of the factors in success. good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle. the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my country s knight in shining armour. he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today - but people are almost too scared to express them. kilroy silk has secured my vote and many more like me. what s more i look forward to the day when he claims victory wrecks the eu and rescues my great nation... without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever! great stuff. the longer the uk dithers over europe the richer we in ireland become as the only english-speaking country fully committed to europe. oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants - our economy needs them. this is just what the europhiles pray for. as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe. having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further. thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone - now ukip at least has a chance in the election! it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip. robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer. instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation. last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk. it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting. ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu. this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk. if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another. so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow! interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name! every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country. kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities. recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come! well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party. it s all flash and no real policy here let s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity. veritas the name will doom it. but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that
520,fiat chief takes steering wheel the chief executive of the fiat conglomerate has taken day-to-day control of its struggling car business in an effort to turn it around. sergio marchionne has replaced herbert demel as chief executive of fiat auto with mr demel leaving the company. mr marchionne becomes the fourth head of the business - which is expected to make a euro ($) loss in - in as many years. fiat underperformed the market in europe last year seeing flat sales. the car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years and was forced to push back its break-even target from to . the management changes are part of a wider shake-up of the business following fiat s resolution of its dispute with general motors. as part of a major restructuring fiat is to integrate the maserati car company - currently owned by ferrari - within its own operations. ferrari in which fiat owns a majority stake could be separately floated on the stock market in either or . mr marchionne who only joined the company last year said fiat auto was now the principal focus of his attention. i have made the decision to take on the post of chief executive of the auto unit to speed up the company s recovery he said. a profound cultural transformation is underway following a management reorganisation that has delivered a more agile and efficient structure he added. although mr marchionne does not have a background in the car industry he has been playing an increasing role in the group s activities. last year he said that a series of new models launched as part of the group s recovery plan had not boosted revenues as much as hoped. the car business best known for its alfa romeo marque is expected to make a loss of about euros in . sales are expected to fall in fiat said this week as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental car market. mr demel a car industry veteran took the helm in november after being recruited by former fiat chief executive giuseppe morchio. mr morchio made a bid last year to become chairman after the death of president umberto agnelli. however this was rejected by the founding agnelli family and mr morchio subsequently resigned. earlier this week fiat reached an agreement with gm to dissolve an alliance which could have obliged gm to buy the italian firm outright. gm will pay fiat $ as part of the settlement.

1936,more power to the people says hp the digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories according to carly fiorina chief of technology giant hewlett packard. the job of firms such as hp now she said in a speech at the consumer electronics show (ces) was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. she said the goal for was to make people the centre of technology. ces showcases new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in . the tech-fest the largest of its kind in the world runs from to january. the digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible she told delegates. revolution has always been about giving power to the people. she added: the real story of the digital revolution is not just new products but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell. part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content such as images video and music. crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device such as a digital camera to others such as portable media players. a lot of work still needs to be done however to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly she said. ms fiorina s talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle fashion and personalisation something she sees as key to what people want. special guest singer gwen stefani joined her on-stage to promote her own range of hp digital cameras which ms stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by japanese youth culture. the digital cameras which are due to go on sale in the us by the summer are based on the hp model. the emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year s ces with tiny wearable players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. ms fiorina also announced that hp was working with nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles which would launch in europe early this year. the service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content like a track s ringtone simultaneously. the service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive. among the other new products she showcased was the digital media hub a big upgrade to hp s digital entertainment centre. coming out in the autumn in the us the box is a networked high-definition tv cable set-top box digital video recorder and dvd recorder. it has a removable hard drive cartridge memory card slots and light scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised dvd labels and covers. it is designed to contain all a household s digital media such as pre-recorded tv shows pictures videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. the hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the pc so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. research suggests that about million images are saved and shared every day equating to billion a year. eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. ms fiorina was one of several keynote speakers who also included microsoft chief bill gates to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next months. in a separate announcement during the keynote speech ms fiorina said that hp would be partnering mtv to replace this year s mtv asia music award. mtv s asia aid will be held in bangkok on february and is aimed at helping to raise money for the asian tsunami disaster.

431,blair backs pre-election budget tony blair has backed chancellor gordon brown s pre-budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy. in a speech in edinburgh the prime minister said thursday s report reinforced stability and opportunity. and that would be central to labour s next election campaign planning for which was already well advanced. mr brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises. he told bbc radio s today programme: no politician should make the mistake that john major and his colleagues made in of saying no matter what the circumstances are they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing. that is not what politicians should do it would not be responsible to do. mr brown insisted his spending plans were affordable and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability which he said was the cornerstone of labour s programme. in a speech at edinburgh s napier university he said labour would publish over the next few months a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term . in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future much clearer than those in or . all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity security and stability for all mr blair said. in his pre-budget report mr brown surprised some city experts by forecasting uk growth at between % and .% for next year. many believe the figure is more likely to be under % - and fear tax rises or spending cuts saying tax receipts have been overestimated. carl emmerson from the institute for fiscal studies told bbc news: he thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will in fact be ok. we re not so sure. david page of investec securities said: his forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of £ is way too optimistic. it s going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets. conservative shadow chancellor oliver letwin said: i can t find a single economic forecaster from the imf to the institute of fiscal studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. in order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election. mr letwin accused the chancellor of using fancy statistics to hide public service failures. vincent cable for the liberal democrats called on mr brown to open up the government s books to the national audit office to see if he had met his golden rule . it is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending mr cable told mps.

161,howard s unfinished business he s not finished yet whispered the conservative party person as your reporter attempted to slip quietly from the hall. and indeed he wasn t. michael howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech at his party s spring conference in brighton to deliver a smart rebuff to peter hain s description of him as an attack mongrel claiming such personal abuse meant labour was rattled by the tory challenge. and here he was again moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause to make a personal ad-libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory. one day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as i will tell mine i was there. i did my bit. i played my part. i helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better . the speech which was peppered with references to mr howard s humble beginnings as the child of immigrants had been introduced by his son nick a trainee vicar who praised his father s honesty. i always know where i am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me he said. mr howard was also joined on stage by his wife sandra daughter larissa and stepson sholto. the audience s reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards. but mr howard s overall message - that the tories have labour on the run and that they can win the next election - did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago. mr howard claimed with some justification that the tories campaign has got off to a great start . they have had labour on the back foot over immigration with tony blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card and have even managed to score points in traditional labour territory such as health and education. the stunts involving margaret dixon with her postponed operation and maria hutchings with concerns about her son s special needs education may not have been to everyone s taste but they succeeded in bringing the issues alive and forcing labour to react. senior tories believe they are at long last starting to tap into the public mood cutting through the background noise to connect with the ordinary voter. their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline cleaner hospitals ( i mean how hard is it to keep a hospital clean ) and immigration ( it s not racist to impose limits on immigration ) - under the headline are you thinking what we are thinking this they say contrasts with labour s negative campaigning such as its now infamous flying pigs poster. oliver letwin one of the men lampooned in the labour poster affects bewilderment at what he believes is labour s loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail. the peter hain mongrel attack he says is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong - a by-product he claims of the tories setting the agenda. i have to say i don t understand what they are doing. the labour machine appears to be in some kind of state of shock it doesn t seem to know what to do. a few weeks of positive headlines have also done wonders for tory activists morale - likely to be a crucial factor at an election which most analysts seem to agree will hinge on which party can get their core support out. it has been a fantastic few weeks said -year-old politics student nick vaughan. our policies have been getting in the media and there is a sense that we can win. i wouldn t be here if i didn t think we could. some delegates even spoke of the next election being like when ted heath behind in the polls and written off by the pundits snatched victory from harold wilson s labour party. they all insisted it was not going to be a re-run of . we thought in we were going to dent that massive majority but it just didn t happen said john murray of aldridge browhills conservatives. it was very disappointing. this time it really is different. whoever is running our strategy from the top has got it bang on. blair is on the back foot. much of the credit for the tories recent change of fortune must go to lynton crosby the australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no-hoper john howard of australia s liberal party into a serial election winner. the tories still have a mountain climb if michael howard is to walk through the doors of number . even allowing for the natural bias against the tories in some opinion polls they are still behind when to have a chance of overturning labour s whopping majority they should really be ahead. but as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper the party at least has reason to hope that like his australian namesake mr howard really isn t finished yet.
1771,apple laptop is greatest gadget the apple powerbook has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc. the laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs. the magazine has compiled an all-time top list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the zenith remote control at two. gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. the magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device . in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine. in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded. the oldest gadget in the top is the abacus which the magazine dates at a.d. and put in place. other pre-electronic gadgets in the top include the sextant from ( position) the marine chronometer from ( position) and the kodak brownie camera from ( position). the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top which also includes the first flash player (diamound multimedia) as well as the first successful digital camera (casio qv-) and mobile phone (motorola startac). the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number . sony s third entry in the top is the cdp- cd player from . who can forget the crystalline hiss-free blast of madonna s like a virgin emenating from their first cd player asked the magazine. karl elsener s knife the swiss army knife from is at number in the list. gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone () the nintendo gameboy () and the pulsar quartz digital watch (). the list also contains plenty of oddities: the pez sweet dispenser () toy tamagotchi () and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (). why worry about mobile phones. soon they will be subsumed into the pda s / laptops etc. what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. for it s time a technological marvel! sony net minidisc! it paved the way for more player to explode onto the market. i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it. a laptop computer is not a gadget! it s a working tool! the sinclair executive was the world s first pocket calculator. i think this should be there as well. how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors. are the people who created this list insane surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionalised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly. has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker an interesting list. of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early blessed the original noteboook pc - the tandy . the size of paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem. a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible. what s an apple powerbook it s out of date - not much of a gadget . surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves it has to be the mobile phone. no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time. the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule. the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in . a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off. all top are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else. i say this as the swiss army knife only made no . sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time. the first home machine with a true multi-takings os. shame the marketing was so bad!!! apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else. utter rubbish. yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets. but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. no competition. i d also put apple s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason. i only wish that vulcan inc s flipstart wasn t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top. how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise) what about radios and tvs the swiss army knife. by far the most useful gadget. i got mine years ago. still wearing and using it a lot! it stood the test of time. psion organiser series should be up there. had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable. case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first i think). great product innovation. the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile pc ! why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site it s obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that. the motorola startac should be number one. why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices. the psion series ! the first most practical way to carry all your info around... i too would back the sinclair spectrum - without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now. i d have put the mobile phone high up the list. probably a nokia model. sinclair spectrum - . it plugged into the tv. games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that s what i do for a living now. i wish more modern notebooks -- even apple s newest offerings -- were more like the . particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses. they re invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use. congratulations to apple a deserved win!
1697,army chiefs in regiments decision military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of scotland s army regiments. a committee of the army board which is made up of the most senior defence figures will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on monday. the proposals include cutting scotland s six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment. the plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. the committee s decision must be ratified by defence secretary geoff hoon and prime minister tony blair. it is expected that it will be made public next week. when ministers announced a reorganisation of the army it drew a question mark over the futures of the black watch the kings own scottish borderers the royal scots the royal highland fusiliers and the argyll and sutherland highlanders. in october the council of scottish colonels proposed the merger of the royal scots and the king s own scottish borderers into a single battalion. under their vision it would be one of five in the new super regiment. the proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry with labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan. they felt the timing was insensitive because the black watch was in the frontline in iraq suffering casualties. the save the scottish regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against labour at the next general election. speaking ahead of the expected army board meeting a spokesman said: the government and the army board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the scottish regiments are for the good of the army and for that of the serving soldier. they are very much not for the good and will destroy scotland s regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to scotland of an important part of her heritage and most importantly her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world. an alternative blueprint had been put forward by labour mp eric joyce who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. for a brief time there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan but that now seems unlikely. speaking in scotland last week mr blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely. he said: they don t want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly. the prime minister said he hoped campaigners concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.

806,china keeps tight rein on credit china s efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into state media report. the curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. growth in china remains at a breakneck .% and corporate investment is growing at more than % a year. the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above % for more than a year. rapid tooling-up of china s manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. in theory the government has a % growth target but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a hard landing in the shape of an overbalancing economy. a low exchange rate - china s yuan is pegged to a rate of . to the dollar which seems to be in relentless decline - means chinese exports are cheap on world markets. china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. to some extent the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. industrial output grew .% in the year to october down from % in february and inflation slowed to .% - although retail sales are still booming.

1148,council tax rise reasonable welsh councils should set their taxes at reasonable levels after being given an average funding increase of % says the assembly government. finance minister sue essex said it was a good deal for local government. the £. settlement includes the full £. from the uk treasury announced by chancellor gordon brown. but opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. in addition £. will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. she said where spending rises were kept to around % she was confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels. the welsh local government association (wlga) had said on the eve of the announcement said that significant cuts to services may still be unavoidable. after the announcement wlga finance spokesman bob wellington of torfaen said it was vital that rises were minimsed. a limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems said mr wellington. it is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase. on monday a delegation of north wales councils visited ms essex to lobby for increased funds. ms essex said: i have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises. i have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and i am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties. she said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels even for those people who have moved up a band . the settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a .% rise in capital expenditure support. ms essex said: this is a good deal for local government which will allow the well-managed councils of wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. it is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level. plaid cymru s local government spokesman dai lloyd called the announcement hugely disappointing . he said: wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. this is not whinging as the labour assembly government so often claims - it is anger. this will mean either a massive hike in council tax massive cuts in services provided by councils or both. mike german leader of the liberal democrats in the assembly claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. mr german said: i know from my discussions with welsh liberal democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. but the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty. conservative local government spokesman glyn davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in wales should see very little change is taking spin to the very verge of deception . he added: around a third of welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.
1193,gadget market to grow in the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into delegates at the world s largest gadget show in las vegas have been told. the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by % while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important. everything is going digital kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association told the bbc news website. the consumer electronics show (ces) featured the pick of s products. consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs [high-definition tvs] digital radio and digital cameras will remain strong in . all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry. despite showing diversity some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much wow factor as in previous years. the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces which was the time and place shifting of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere at any time. at the start of last year s ces the cea predicted there would be an average growth of % in . that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players personal video recorders and digital cameras. it was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. part of this has been the rise in spending power of the generation x-ers who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. more than % of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers according to cea research. hybrid devices which combine a number of multimedia functions were also in evidence on the show floor. a lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it said stephen baker a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group. some of these functions cost next to nothing to add. as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable players to giant high-definition tvs several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders such as microsoft chief bill gates. despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate s pre-show speech he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the us market. he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. he disappointed some however by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console. another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony s new portable games device the psp had at the show. sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe. it went on sale in japan before christmas. there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their consumer technology offering. elsewhere at the show there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens including samsung s -inch (. metre) plasma - the largest in the world. industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in with new formats for dvds coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional dvds. with so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage like seagate s pocket sized external hard drive which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. more than trade professionals attended ces in las vegas which officially ran from to january.

524,disney backs sony dvd technology a next generation dvd technology backed by sony has received a major boost. film giant disney says it will produce its future dvds using sony s blu-ray disc technology but has not ruled out a rival format developed by toshiba. the two competing dvd formats blu-ray developed by sony and others and toshiba s hd-dvd have been courting top film studios for several months. the next generation of dvds promises very high quality pictures and sound as well as a lot of data. both technologies use a blue laser to write information. it has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the betamax versus vhs war. sony lost out to jvc in that fight. the current battle for hollywood s hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. last month paramount universal and warner brothers said they were opting for the toshiba and nec-backed format hd-dvd high-definition discs. those studios currently produce about % of dvd content. sony pictures entertainment and mgm studios have already staked their allegiance with the blu-ray disc association whose members also include technology companies dell samsung and matsushita. twentieth century fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. if fox decided to go with blu-ray too it would mean the format would have a % share of dvd content. disney said its films would be available on the blu-ray format when dvd players for the standard went on sale on north america and japan expected in . universal is to start producing films on the hd-dvd format in and paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in . toshiba expects sales of hd-dvds to reach yen ($. £.) by .
813,us budget deficit to reach $ the us budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $ (£) this year officials said on tuesday. the cost of military operations still needs to be factored in with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $ in the red. past congressional budget office (cbo) forecasts said there would be a $ shortfall in the fiscal year. in recent months the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. in november the gap between us exports and imports widened to more than $ a record figure. the cbo says it envisages a further orderly decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. but the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost us economic growth. the budget deficit hit a record $ in the months to september after reaching $ in the previous fiscal year. the cbo also forecast a total shortfall of $ for the years from to an improvement on previous projections. however analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $-$. trillion costs of the president s plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. the figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the september attacks and ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan. one of president george w bush s election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. but democrats have accused the president of excluding iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit a charge which the administration denies. on tuesday the us administration asked congress for additional funds for military operations.
839,format wars could confuse users technology firms sony philips matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video. the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different and conflicting content control systems experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy. currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device independent of how they originally obtained that content . the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music movies and other digital content they have bought. called the marlin joint development association the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium. the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft. confusingly for consumers the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple. in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats such as betamax and vhs that consumers have seen in the past said ian fogg personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research. the difference is that it is very fragmented he said. it s not a two-horse race it s a five six seven or even eight-horse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families. although initiatives such as microsoft s plays for sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty he said life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come. shelley taylor analyst and author of a report about online music services said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. apple s itunes service was a perfect example of this she said. although itunes has been hugely successful apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods she said. she said rampant competition between online music services of which there are now according to recent figures could drive more openness and freer file formats. it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run she said and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest. ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. people want portability she said and with peer-to-peer they have % portability. cory doctorow european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims. not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying he said. he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. instead said mr doctorow drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version the auto version the american and uk version the ringtone version and so on.

1101,talks aim to avert pension strike talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend. five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour s spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from to . up to . workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for march. however all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days britain s biggest union unison will start balloting local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers. the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the less painful option our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice he said. if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. in the century it s completely unacceptable. unison s workers the transport and general workers union s and amicus are among those being balloted about a march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.

275,report attacks defence spending the ministry of defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects. a national audit office report on the biggest projects says costs have risen by £. in the past year. it says there is little evidence the mod s performance had improved despite the introduction of a smart acquisition policy six years ago. a senior defence official told the bbc lessons were being learned. the nao s annual report showed the total cost of the projects covered was expected to reach £ - % higher than originally planned. the total delays amounted to months with average individual delays rising by three months. sir john bourn head of the nao said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied. many problems can be traced to the fact that the mod has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase the report says. the nao found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older legacy projects such as the eurofighter. a senior defence official speaking to the bbc s defence correspondent paul adams said that although the figures were still not good enough the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle. this year s overspend was significantly less than last year s £. total and the defence procurement agency - which is responsible for buying defence equipment - was improving. lord bach minister for defence procurement said he was obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown but insisted that the defence procurement agency had undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects . the latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last months and according to our correspondent contain few new surprises. turning around the defence procurement agency was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker - it takes a very long time indeed he said. our correspondent said it was the same projects including the joint strike fighter the nimrod and aircraft and the type destroyer which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay. but he added some projects such as the c- heavy lift aircraft and successor identification friend or foe (siff) were showing good performances.
455,uk net users leading tv downloads british tv viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading us shows from the net according to research. new episodes of desperate housewives and six feet under appear on the web hours after they are shown in the us said a report. web tracking company envisional said % of downloaders were from within the uk and that downloads of tv programmes had increased by % in the last year. about % were using file-sharing program bittorrent the firm said. it s now as easy to download a pirate tv show as it is to programme a vcr said ben coppin from envisional. a typical episode of was downloaded by about people globally said the report and an estimated of those were from within the uk. fans of many popular us tv programmes like usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the uk. but in some cases said the report people were able to watch the new episodes in britain before us audiences on the west coast of the country. missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet explained mr coppin. two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. in effect the internet is now a global video recorder. exact figures are difficult to pin down but it is thought that about to people in the uk download tv programmes. some may just want the odd episode others are downloading regularly. many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content like tv programmes. this presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. it is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. the industry has coined the term time-shifting to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want when you want. the increased popularity of personal digital video recorders tivo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like sky+ have also contributed to the trend. there are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store tv programmes for viewers effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer. within half an hour recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. because they tend to be shorter then full-length films they can be processed - digitised - quickly. more people with high-speed broadband connections in the uk also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly. according to jupiter research % of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. the envisional reports said that the tv industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. the bbc ran a trial of what it calls the interactive media player (imp) last year which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. it let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. it is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. the bbc already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. about six million people in the uk now have a fast always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.
2054,tories leave door open for archer the conservative party would deal sympathetically with any application by disgraced peer lord archer to rejoin its ranks its co-chairman has said. dr liam fox told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme there was no place for vindictiveness in politics. lord archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. the former tory deputy chairman s five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed. a jury ruled that lord archer lied during a libel trial against the daily star at the high court in london in . he won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute. dr fox was asked if he would say yes or no if lord archer applied to rejoin. i m sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong we would look at that sympathetically. i don t believe in vindictiveness i don t think that has any place in politics unlike the prime minister and alastair campbell. tory peer lord tebbit said he agreed with dr fox s view and said the case should be looked at on its merits. after all he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world he added. meanwhile senior conservative mp sir teddy taylor warned that moves bring lord archer back into the fold could be controversial. he said: i suppose on a sunday in particular we should always make provision for forgiving sinners. but there is no doubt it would be controversial. lord archer who was not available for comment remains a popular figure among constituency tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. he has not been seen in the house of lords since his release from prison in july although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.
2000,oil companies get russian setback international oil and mining companies have reacted cautiously to russia s decision to bar foreign firms from natural resource tenders in . us oil giant exxon said it did not plan to take part in a new tender on a project for which it had previously signed a preliminary agreement. miner highland gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while bp a big investor declined to comment. only firms at least % russian-owned will be permitted to bid. the federal natural resources agency said the government is interested in letting russian companies develop strategic resources . the foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to russia s competition law natural resources minister yuri trutnev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency. no further details were given with mr trutnev suggesting that russia may decide on a case-by-case basis. observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy as the administration of vladimir putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics. russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stock-market listed company yukos a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors. analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals. companies echoed this sentiment saying that they would require more information before ringing the alarm bells. it s not good. but it is very understandable said al breach an economist at ubs brunswick. but if the investment climate is stable - that s much more important. foreigners of course would like to have free entry but... this is not the end of the world. a number of other nations including mexico saudi arabia and kuwait protect their national resources from foreign firms. what has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism russia has been courting foreign investment. bp spent $. to create russian-registered oil company tnk-bp and has a partnership to develop the sakhalin petroleum field with state-owned rosneft. exxon the world s largest oil company has signed preliminary agreements to develop the sakhalin field. company spokesman glenn waller said exxon still considered the deal valid despite russia inviting new offers for the land block. according to mr waller exxon were not planning to bid at a new tender anyway . we regret the ministry has taken such a decision said ivan kulakov deputy chairman of highland gold - a mining firm that has the motto bringing russia s gold to market . it would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate. other firms that have been linked with investment in russia include france s total the us-based chevrontexaco and miner barrick gold.
2055,jobs growth still slow in the us the us created fewer jobs than expected in january but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years. according to labor department figures us firms added only jobs in january. the gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of new jobs. nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to .% its lowest level since september . the job gains mean that president bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the us economy in his first term in office. he presided over a net fall in jobs up to last november s presidential election - the first president to do so since herbert hoover. as a result job creation became a key issue in last year s election. however when adding december and january s figures the administration s first term jobs record ended in positive territory. the labor department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in december from to . analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. it suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace said rick egelton deputy chief economist at bmo financial group. we are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment. the economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth said ken mayland president of clearview economics. that means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.
788,virus poses as christmas e-mail security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card. the zafi.d virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. anti-virus firm sophos said that % of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus. like many other windows viruses zafi-d plunders microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. the attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces. the virus subject line says merry christmas and translates this into one of languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. the message in the body of the e-mail reads: happy holidays and this too is translated. on infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus. the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america italy spain bulgaria and hungary. the original zafi virus appeared in april this year. we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards and we recommend this to all our clients too said mikko hypponen who heads f-secure s anti-virus team.

($.; £) from a year earlier. analysts expected a figure closer to a$. qantas shares fell almost % however after it warned that earnings growth would slow in the second half. sales will dip by at least a$ after the indian ocean tsunami devastated many holiday destinations qantas said. the tsunami affected travel patterns in ways that we were a bit surprised about chief executive geoff dixon explained. it certainly affected japanese travel into australia. as soon as the tsunami hit we saw ... a lessening with bookings for australia. higher fuel costs also are expected to eat into earnings in coming months. we don t have as much hedging benefit in the second half as we had in the first said chief financial officer peter gregg. qantas is facing increased pressure from rivals such as low-cost carrier virgin blue and the australian government is in talks about whether to allow singapore airlines to fly between the australia and the us - one of qantas key routes. even so the firm is predicting that full-year earnings will increase from the previous months. analysts have forecast full-year profit will rise about % to around a$ million ($ million). qantas boss mr dixon also said he would be reviewing the group s cost-cutting measures. during the first six months of the fiscal year qantas made savings of a$ and is on track to top its target of a$ for the full year. last month the company warned it may transfer as many as jobs out australia with mr dixon quoted as saying that the carrier could no longer afford to remain all-australian .
97,ireland win eclipses refereeing errors the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up. it may have to go the whole way and have nfl-style video cameras all over the field or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles. what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. sunday s explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since . the game was as exciting as it comes with a much-improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. one can understand that frustration. there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their - victory but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport s blazers . referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece. i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made. after all he has no public recourse to criticism. it was the same for simon mcdowell the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france. as far as england were concerned there were queries over mark cueto s first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick. england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup. on that occasion david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end. lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. however one has to credit ireland flanker johnny o connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. but in rugby everything tends to even out over the minutes. the referee also missed england s danny grewcock taking out ronan o gara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line. those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes. but there were many more and one should not take away from those. brian o driscoll s winning try was as well-conceived as they come while charlie hodgson s brilliant kicking display was another highlight. and ronan o gara s tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final minutes. two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on. the first was denis hickie s brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross-field kick then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try. ireland s second-row colossus paul o connell was equally superb. england had turned ireland one way then the other and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. unfortunately he ran into o connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. that spoke volumes about ireland s back-foot display with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end. to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward. it may be tries that win games but it is defence that wins championships.

1171,euronext poised to make lse bid pan-european group euronext is poised to launch a bid for the london stock exchange uk media reports say. last week the lse rejected a takeover proposal from german rival deutsche boerse - the pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about £.. the lse which saw its shares rise % said the bid undervalued the business. euronext - formed after the brussels paris and amsterdam exchanges merged - is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer. the lse europe s biggest stock market is a key prize listing stocks with a total capitalisation of £. trillion. euronext already has a presence in london due to its acquisition of london-based options and futures exchange liffe. trades on the lse are cleared via clearnet in which euronext has a quarter stake. euronext which also operates an exchange in lisbon last week appointed ubs and abn amro as additional advisors. it is also working with morgan stanley. despite the rejection of the deutsche boerse bid last week werner seifert chief executive of the frankfurt-based exchange may well come back with an improved offer. it has long wanted to link up with london and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in . responding to the lse s rebuff deutsche boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than £ - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits and that it still hoped to make a cash bid. last week the lse said not only was the bid undervalued but that it had been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented . however it has indicated it is open for further talks. meanwhile german magazine der spiegel said part of mr seifert s negotiations with the lse were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange. while mr seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of london the mayor of frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost german jobs. many analysts believe german boerse has more financial firepower than euronext if it came to a bidding war.
544,bening makes awards breakthrough film actress annette bening is up for an oscar for her starring role in the award-winning film being julia. bening who was born in texas in has gained prominence for a string of key roles. although an oscar has so far eluded her her status as one of hollywood s favourite actresses remains solid. one of the biggest oscars buzzes in recent years was for bening s role as troubled carolyn burnham in s american beauty. but her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of hilary swank s leading role in boys don t cry. after opening her career in the theatre - and gaining a tony award nomination in - bening had a low-key spell in television. she then made her film debut as a sex-starved wife in s the great outdoors opposite comics dan akroyd and john candy. following a cameo in postcards from the edge bening s breakthrough role came in playing seductive con artist myra langtry in the grifters - a role that won her an oscar nomination. despite some rave reviews bening did not win the best supporting actress academy award. however the high-profile performance enabled bening to capture roles in a number of big budget hollywood productions co-starring with some of hollywood s greatest players including robert de niro and harrison ford. but it was her role opposite warren beatty in gangster flick bugsy which had the greatest impact. bening played virginia hill another role which won her high critical acclaim but the film only picked up two of a staggering oscar nominations. bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for bening - she married beatty with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in europe. the couple now have four children together. a pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered bening s career in the mid-. she played michael douglas opposite number in romantic comedy the american president and as a fiery queen elizabeth i in a contemporary adaptation of shakespeare s richard iii. bening was the first choice to play the female lead in american beauty director sam mendes film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a bafta award for her strong performance. but current film being julia has made bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee with success at the golden globes. the witty tale of revenge and love set in london sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young american - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted academy award.
2109,court halts mark morrison album premiership footballer and record company boss kevin campbell has gained a court injunction stopping r&b singer mark morrison from releasing an album. the everton striker signed morrison to his fledging wikid records label and claims he spent thousands of pounds producing his album innocent man. now he is attempting to prevent morrison releasing the album on monday through another label. but morrison vowed to ignore the order saying no judge is gonna stop me . morrison who is now as well known for his brushes with the law than his music career rose to fame with the single return of the mack. but the leicester singer has struggled to repeat its success following two spells in jail. one was for hiring a stand-in to complete his community service for possession of a stun gun and three-months following a nightclub fracas. he signed to mr campbell s label a year ago and has released one single with the label saying the album was due for release on january. but mr campbell said he learned that morrison planned to release the album through jet star which is advertising it on its website. mr campbell said: i m glad we were granted the injunction but i m completely gutted that we have had to go that far. mark morrison was given everything he asked for by wikid but it seems that he couldn t help but return to his old ways. i ve worked hard to realise my ambition in football but had hoped that my future career would be in the music business. i have always dreamt of starting a record label but now mark morrison has spoilt that dream for me. there is no loyalty in this business - just greed. but morrison is determined the album will be released on monday. he said: the injunction is ludicrous. i signed a new deal with a new record company because i was not getting the support i needed from wikid. i was with that label for a year and in that time released just one record which was not properly promoted. he added: the whole world is waiting for this album and it will come out on december . no injunction or judge will stop it. the mack will return. the case is set to be heard in the high court on december.
1870,jones doping probe begins an investigation into doping claims against marion jones has been opened by the international olympic committee. ioc president jacques rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by victor conte of balco laboratories. jones who says she is innocent could lose all her olympic medals after conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the sydney olympics. but rogge said it was too early to speculate about that hoping only that the truth will emerge . any decision on the medals would be taken by the ioc s executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the games closing. the sydney olympics ended more than four years ago but world anti-doping agency chief dick pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now. we will find a way to deal with that pound said. in a statement released through her attorney rich nichols jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared. victor conte s allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward she said. conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory inconsistent statements.
1018,defection timed to hit tax pledge with impeccable and precisely-calculated timing tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard s latest announcement on taxation and spending. with just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories resolutely depressing poll showings. the big idea is his £ savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts. and it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the bbc one s breakfast with frost programme. he and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now but without any concrete pledges. but mr howard announced that of the £ he has earmarked from savings £ will be used to plug labour s claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin s first budget. he would not be precise but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax. but he did for the first time say there would be such tax cuts. at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less . it is the tories attempt to open that famed clear blue water between them and the labour party and return to a traditional tory agenda that will both reassure the middle england voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core conservative voters. so it is a pretty safe bet to assume that when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact. mr howard however was dismissive. these things happen from time to time. there are disagreements between robert jackson and me. the election is not going to be decided on what robert jackson did he added. and that is certainly true. the election will be decided on the economy stupid . other issues like the iraq war and the trust thing will also play a major part. but it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote. and many on the tory benches have been crying out for mr howard to get back onto the old tory tax cuts agenda. mr howard knows that risks accusations that as a result he would slash public services so he has attempted to shoot that fox first. with polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts he has suggested that is exactly what he will do. whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen.
1755,metal slug offers retro fun like some drill sergeant from the past metal slug is a wake-up call to today s gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings. with its hand-animated sprites and side-scrolling this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. but a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. and yes that includes halo . simply choose your grunt and wade through five side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. it is also the toughest game you are likely to play as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on. players must battle soldiers snowmen zombies giant crabs and aliens not to mention the huge screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels. the shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers instead to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. tanks jets and submarines can be commandeered as well as cannon-toting camels elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq. doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls and while this is a tough nut to crack it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go. and at a mere £ metal slug is as cheap as sliced fried spuds as the man says. of course most of you will ignore this lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation metal slug is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates eye.
912,confusion over high-definition tv now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital tv dvds and digital video recorders the next revolution for tv is being prepared for our sets. in most corners of tv and technology industries high-definition (hdtv) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour. hd essentially makes tv picture quality at least four times better than now. but there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about hd on the high street. thousands of flat panel screens - lcds (liquid crystal displays) plasma screens and dlp rear-projection tv sets - have already been sold as hd but are in fact not able to display hd. the uk is the largest display market in europe according to john binks director of gfk which monitors global consumer markets. but he added: of all the flat panel screens sold just .% in the uk are capable of getting high-definition. there are different devices that are being sold as hd but are not hd-ready according to alexander oudendijk senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant astra. they may be fantastic quality tvs but many do not have adaptors in them - called dvi or hdmi (high-definition multimedia interface) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the high street say industry experts who gathered at bafta in london for the european hdtv summit last week. we have to be careful about consumer confusion. there is a massive education process to go through said mr binks. the industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it. eventually that will be everyone. the bbc is currently developing plans to produce all its tv output to meet hdtv standards by . preparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas and programmes are being filmed with hd cameras. bskyb plans to ship its first generation set-top boxes to receive hdtv broadcasts in time for christmas. like its sky+ boxes they will also be personal video recorders (pvrs). the company will start broadcasts of hdtv programmes offering them as premium channel packages concentrating to start with on sports big events and films in early . but the set-top box which receives hdtv broadcasts has to plug into a display - tv set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that hd demands if hdtv is to be real . by % of homes in the uk will have some sort of tv set or display that can show hd in its full glory. but it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to being digital . as a result all the key players those who make flat panel displays as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters formed a hd forum in to make sure they were all talking to each other. part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection. but it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for. from next month all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a hd-ready sticker. this also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and hdtv signals and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry. the logo is absolutely the way forward said david mercer analysts with strategy analytics. but it is still not appearing on many retail products. the industry is upbeat that the sticker will help but it is only a start. we can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers said mr oudendijk. there may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months. the european broadcast union (ebu) is testing different flavours of hd formats to prepare for even better hdtv further down the line. it is similarly concerned that people get the right information on hdtv formats as well as which devices will support the formats. we believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile said phil laven technical director for the ebu. the tv display manufacturers want us to watch hd on screens that are at least () to get the true impact of hd they say although smaller displays suffice. what may convince people to spend money on hd-ready devices is the falling prices which continue to tumble across europe. the prices are dropping an average of % every year according to analysts. lcd prices dropped by % in europe as a whole last year according to mr oudendijk.
24,mobile audio enters new dimension as mobile phones move closer to being a ubiquitous all-in-one media player audio is becoming ever more important. but how good can that sound be from such a small device the sound of a buzzing bee jumps from left to right before disappearing around the back of my head. the surround sound demo is unremarkable when heard on a multi-speaker home cinema system but startling when emerging from a small mobile phone. british firm sonaptic is one of a number of companies to have developed audio technology that emerges from stereo speakers. firms and srs both offer stereo-widening technology for mobile phones. but sonaptic s managing director david monteith says his firm is the only company to offer positional audio on a mobile. there are quite a few basic technologies out there making the sound seem a bit bigger headphones a bit nicer. no-one has really tried before to make proper positional audio - where an individual channel can be moved around. sonaptic has been working with japanese mobile network ntt docomo to set standards for audio on mobile phones. in the last few months handsets from nec fujitsu and mitsubishi have been released on to the japanese marker which have chips produced by yamaha and rohm with sonaptic s technology. the technology has been around on pcs and games consoles for some time but what we are doing is making it more efficient so it can go on a small consumer device like a mobile phone said mr monteith. the technology works through applying the science of psychoacoustics and grew out of medical research done by the company s research director dr alastair sibbald. we are basically trying to fool your ears into thinking sound is coming from areas it actually isn t. your brain uses certain bits of information which we are effectively synthesising on a mobile phone handset. the structure of the ear works as a encoder for sound - helping the brain understand from where sound is emanating. sonaptic s audio processing algorithms mimic that encoding giving the impression that sound is coming from the left right and behind a listener when in fact it is coming from a single source. mr montieth says: if the sound is off to one side it will get to one ear before the other - if it is on the right it has to bend around your head to get to your left ear. the shape of your ear causes differences in sound from one ear to the other. we are synthesising those differences. sonaptic hopes the technology will have a big impact in the growing market of mobile gaming and music downloading. handhelds often have limitations - screens will be small by definition. if you want to get impact from media you are running - either a movie a game or watching tv - if you want it to be more immersive then our technology can help. a fishing game is the first title to use the technology creating a sound field while the gamer plays. driving games and shoot em ups using the technology are in development. the technology can also be used for music - giving songs a much more expansive and immersive feel. sonaptic offers its technology on a chip or in software and is about to release a new version which significantly improves the efficiency of the audio processing. it s important we only use or % of the processor otherwise you won t be able to play a game on the handset explained mr montieth. the company is now looking to the us and european markets where it has been working with network vodafone. we have focused first on japan because it has a very advanced mobile phone market. we knew japan would be the first place to have the handsets that could use our technology. there should be handsets out in the uk in the next six months.
193,french suitor holds lse meeting european stock market euronext has met with the london stock exchange (lse) amid speculation that it may be ready to launch a cash bid. euronext chief jean-francois theodore held talks with lse boss clara furse the day after rival deutsche boerse put forward its own bid case. the german exchange said it had held constructive professional and friendly talks with the lse. but euronext declined to comment after the talks ended on friday. speculation is mounting that the germans may raise their bid to £.. deutsche boerse previously offered £. which was rejected by the lse while euronext is rumoured to have facilities in place to fund a £. cash bid. so far however neither have tabled a formal bid. but a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in europe and the second biggest in the world after the new york stock exchange. there was speculation euronext would use friday s meeting as an opportunity to take advantage of growing disquiet over deutsche boerse s own plans for dominance over the london market. unions for deutsche boerse staff in frankfurt has reportedly expressed fears that up to jobs would be moved to london if the takeover is successful. the works council has expressed concerns that the equities and derivatives trade could be managed from london in the future reuters news agency reports a union source as saying. german politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator s promise to move its headquarters to london if a bid were successful. meanwhile lse shareholders fear that deutsche boerse s control over its clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions - would create a monopoly situation. this would weaken the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. lse and euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive. the german group s ownership of clearstream has been seen as the main stumbling block to a london-frankfurt merger. commentators believe deutsche boerse which has now formally asked german authorities to approve its plan to buy the lse may offer to sell clearstream to gain shareholder approval. euronext so far has given little away as to what sweeteners it will offer the lse - europe s biggest equity market - into a deal.
433,benitez issues warning to gerrard liverpool manager rafael benitez has ordered captain steven gerrard not to play down their champions league ambitions and be more positive. gerrard told the bbc liverpool were unlikely to win the trophy this year. benitez responded: i spoke to steven and said to him that in future it s better to think we can win the champions league. why not he said: we need winners here and everyone thinking only of winning. i always want to win. benitez added: when we lose i only think of solutions. if you only think about winning the next game you don t know what the draw will be. if we can win the next game maybe we will draw a side that isn t so strong or a side with injuries or suspensions. benitez is hoping to win his first trophy since arriving at liverpool from valencia when they play chelsea in the carling cup on sunday in cardiff.
1753,wembley firm won t make a profit shares in multiplex group which is building the new wembley stadium fell as much as % after it said it would not make any money on the project. the australian firm said it would only break even on the . australian dollars (£; $) rebuild after a rise in costs on the work. any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor it added. it cut a$ from profit targets for wembley and another uk project. investors were shaken by the news and the firm s shares fell to a four month low of a$. before recovering to close % down at a$.. the decline came despite multiplex reporting an % rise in pre-tax profits to a$. for and reaffirming its profit forecasts. increased costs at wembley and a separate development in london s docklands saw multiplex s construction division report profits of a$.. the firm said the result was below expectations but stressed that the majority of its uk projects - which also include the white city redevelopment scheme in west london - were performing strongly. to recoup any profit from wembley where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors. these claims could take up to two years to resolve. multiplex believes its claim are sound and ultimately will exceed the level needed to support the break even position it said. it is expected that profits will be possible in future periods as the claims are finalised. wembley stadium is to due to be completed in january and will officially open for the fa cup final. analysts expressed concern at the unexpected paring back in profit. such a big writeback on the wembley project in such a short period has impacted on management credibility simon wheatley from goldman sachs told reuters.
573,how to smash a home computer an executive who froze his broken hard disk thinking it would be fixed has topped a list of the weirdest computer mishaps. although computer malfunctions remain the most common cause of file loss data recovery experts say human behaviour still is to blame in many cases. they say that no matter how effective technology is at rescuing files users should take more time to back-up and protect important files. the list of the top global data disasters was compiled by recovery company ontrack. careless - and preventable - mistakes that result in data loss range from reckless file maintenance practices to episodes of pure rage towards a computer. this last category includes the case of a man who became so mad with his malfunctioning laptop that he threw it in the lavatory and flushed a couple of times. data can disappear as a result of natural disaster system fault or computer virus but human error including computer rage seems to be a growing problem said adrian palmer managing director of ontrack data recovery. nevertheless victims soon calm down when they realise the damage they ve done and come to us with pleas for help to retrieve their valuable information. a far more common situation is when a computer virus strikes and leads to precious files being corrupted or deleted entirely. mr palmer recalled the case of a couple who had hundreds of pictures of their baby s first three months on their computer but managed to reformat the hard drive and erase all the precious memories. data can be recovered from computers servers and even memory cards used in digital devices in most cases said mr palmer. however individuals and companies can avoid the hassle and stress this can cause by backing up data on a regular basis.
1371,concerns at school diploma plan final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for england s secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report. the government s response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing - qualifications is expected next week. some are worried it could be scuppered if as tony blair and ruth kelly have suggested gcses and a-levels stay. sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday. it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response said the chairman of the commons education select committee labour mp barry sheerman. his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. we must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system he wrote in the times educational supplement. it is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak. the qualifications and curriculum authority (qca) has also told the government not to compromise . the qca said the potential step-change in participation and attainment lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. any partial implementation of the proposals would in our view compromise that integrity said its chairman sir anthony greener. it is a sign of the qca s concern that its advice went to ministers last december but was publicised only recently. but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills. they may be content if it does not close too many doors in writing - whatever spin is put on it. the chief inspector of schools david bell also said recently that gcses and a-levels should go. one of the reasons why i m so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it s good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system he said. if we don t say this is a sea-change in education we will miss a great opportunity. universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. a note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers organisation the cbi which complains of a lack of skills. in an attempt to address this the tomlinson plan is for tests in functional maths and literacy - decidedly not gcses. it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms concerns on this score. another dissenter is sir mike tomlinson s predecessor as chief schools inspector professor chris woodhead who has said there is no need for such a massive upheaval . the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top a-level grade no matter how well the others have done.

1623,global blogger action day called the global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned iranian bloggers. the month-old committee to protect bloggers is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on february to the free mojtaba and arash day . arash sigarchi and mojtaba saminejad are both in prison in iran. blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time. i hope this day will focus people curt hopkins director of the committee told the bbc news website. the group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take including writing to local iranian embassies. the committee has deemed tuesday free mojtaba and arash day as part of its first campaign. it is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of mojtaba and arash as well as other cyber-dissidents . if you have a blog the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except free mojtaba and arash day said mr hopkins. that would mean you could see that phrase . million times. that alone will shine some light on the situation. if you don t have one find one dedicated to that - it takes about seconds. technorati a blog search engine tracks about six million blogs and says that more than are added daily. a blog is created every . seconds according to a us research think-tank. the committee to protect bloggers was started by us blogger curt hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger ellen simonetti as a deputy director. she has since started the international bloggers bill of rights a global petition to protect bloggers at work. although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means it aims to be the hub or organisation information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech. the committee although only a month old aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation. blogging is in this weird no man s land. people think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view said mr hopkins. some think of themselves as pundits kind of like journalists and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform. but they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold. it is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. the question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. high profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal and often anonymous blogs have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in. this is a big messy argument explained mr hopkins. he added: it is just such a new way of doing business there will be clamp downs. but the way these issues get tested is through the courts which said mr hopkins is part of the whole messy conversation. if you haven t already got bloggers in your company you will have them tomorrow - and if you don t have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. mr hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. everyone does this - mums radicals conservatives he said. many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. that is the essential difference. what i call templating software gives every single person on earth the chance to have one. you don t even have to have your own computer.
1506,collins banned in landmark case sprinter michelle collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the north american court of arbitration for sport (cas). america s former world indoor champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. collins ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the balco doping scandal. the -year-old was found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs. the us anti-doping agency (usada) decided to press charges against collins in the summer. the sprinter has consistently protested her innocence but the cas has upheld usada s findings. the usada has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that collins took epo the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and thg said a cas statement. collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time. so far a total of athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the balco doping scandal. world record holder tim montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the usada. his hearing before the csa has been rescheduled for june next year. drug enforcement chiefs in the us have vowed to crack down on cheats. usada chief executive officer terry madden said the action taken against collins was further proof of that. the cas panel s decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of usada s ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of us athletes that compete drug-free said madden. the usada has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into balco rather than test results. the san francisco-based balco laboratory faces steroid distribution and money laundering charges. the trial is expected to open next march.
1735,brown calls for £. aids fund gordon brown has called on rich nations to fund a £. ($) plan to fight the aids epidemic and find a vaccine. on the fourth day of his six-day tour of africa the uk chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by if the world stepped up its funding pledges. doubling the £ being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives mr brown said on thursday. he hopes to use the uk s presidency to push the issue forward. i believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat cure and eradicate the world s deadliest disease of today - and today the world s least curable disease - hiv/aids - will rightly earn the title the great generation mr brown said in a speech during his african tour. the problems of hiv/aids were inseparable from poverty he added. at least $ billion per annum (£.) is needed to address the hiv/aids crisis in low and middle income countries. existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic. the uk s proposal for an international finance facility is so important - increasing world aid flows by over $ billion (£). a doubling of world aid to halve world poverty. mr brown also said he had agreed with the italian finance minister domenico siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease. currently the private sector was only spending £ a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting mr brown said. he called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first vaccines at a cost of $ each thereby boosting the market for inoculations. this would be a large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms mr brown added. more must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with hiv/aids and their families he said. but aid charity actionaid criticised mr brown s preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on nations to fund hiv/aids treatments. the charity s head of hiv/aids in britain simon wright said: while encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an hiv vaccine is important a failure to provide any funding for hiv treatments condemns a generation of people to death. hiv is decimating african countries killing the most productive adults who should be working caring for children and building the economy. an hiv vaccine is probably at least years away. treatments are needed now. on wednesday mr brown visited slums in the kenyan capital nairobi . he will visit an hiv/aids orphanage in tanzania and a women s credit union in mozambique before chairing a meeting of the commission for africa in cape town. the chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a aid package which he has likened to the marshall plan used by the united states to rebuild europe after world war two.
1485,few ready for information act thousands of public bodies are ill-prepared for the freedom of information act due to come into force next month because of government failures say mps. from next month anyone will have the power to demand information from a range of public bodies - from whitehall departments to doctors surgeries. but an all-party committee said it was not confident many would be ready. it blamed the department for constitutional affairs for a lack of consistent leadership . the act comes into effect in england wales and northern ireland on january while similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about public bodies subject to various exemptions. but the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an unusually high turnover of staff within the department which had seriously interfered with its work said the constitutional affairs select committee. it said despite four years of preparations some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready. the dca had failed to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a lack of consistent leadership the mps found. committee chairman alan beith said: the dca has had four years to prepare for freedom of information but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared. our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the dca which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime has been lacking. a spokesman for the dca said: the dca has provided - and will continue to provide - strong clear leadership. it has delivered a simple liberal fees regime guidance on the act which has been widely praised and expert networks of staff working on freedom of information implementation.

57,henson stakes early lions claim the six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer. the player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson. he s very confident. you just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there s an element of arrogance it s good arrogance. he certainly showed some nice touches. he once showed a clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand. and that s without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty. but i think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test. he needs to come up against brian o driscoll or a big french midfield. wales fly-half stephen jones was another player who impressed me. he gave good direction he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side. he showed he can control a game. with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number shirt could be up for grabs and jones or maybe even henson could make the lions team at fly-half. jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday s game. some of the wales forwards surprised me because i thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five. england prop julian white is a capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top. however i still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame. some english players did their cause no harm. i thought joe worsley had a solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong. but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and i think it will be a while before we see him again. despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france. tom smith has been there and done it before but the likes of chris cusiter jason white and ally hogg all made their mark. hogg made a couple of good runs while white had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there. cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward. the star of ireland s win over italy in rome looks like a certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand. brian o driscoll is a class act. he ran some good lines against italy made the breaks and fed his outside backs although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him. gordon d arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson d arcy o driscoll combination in the lions midfield. paul o connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and malcolm o kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up while shane byrne seems to be a lively character. but they will be a bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday although i used to play in italy and i know how difficult it can be. one player who didn t impress me was wales scrum-half dwayne peel. he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing. they had good possession and he kicked the ball away - i wouldn t want him as my lions scrum-half after that.
284,anti-tremor mouse stops pc shakes a special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control a computer mouse more easily has been developed. the device uses similar steady cam technology found in camcorders to filter out shaking hand movements. people with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen. about three million britons have some sort of hand tremor condition said the uk national tremor foundation. using a computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so we re delighted to hear that a technology has been developed to address this problem said karen walsh from the uk national tremor foundation. most commonly associated with tremors is parkinson s disease but they can also be caused by other conditions like essential tremor (et). tremors more often affect older people but can hit all ages. et for example is genetic and can afflict people throughout their lives. the assistive mouse adapter (ama) is the brainchild of ibm researcher jim levine who developed the prototype after seeing his uncle who has parkinson s disease struggle with mouse control. i knew that there must be way to improve the situation for him and the millions of other tremor sufferers around the world including the elderly. the number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages and at the same time the need for computer access grows he said. computer users plug the device into a pc and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is. it is also able to recognise multiple clicking on a mouse button caused by shaky digits. ibm said it would partner up with a small uk-based electronics firm montrose secam to produce the devices which will cost about £. james cosgrave one of the company s directors said it would make a big difference to those with tremors. i m a pilot and my tremor condition has not limited my ability to fly a plane he said. but using a pc has proven almost impossible simply because everything revolves around using the mouse to accurately manipulate the tiny cursor on the screen. he said a prototype of the gadget had transformed his life. the device could help open up computing to millions more people who have found shaking to be a barrier. last year the office for national statistics reported that for the first time more than half of all households in britain had a home computer. with prices getting cheaper to get online too computer ownership is increasing. but although % of british people have tried the internet only % of britons aged or over have been online. more than six million uk households now have a broadband net. by the middle of it is estimated that % of all uk net users will be on broadband. there are still millions using the net through dial-up connections too.

1966,kuznetsova failed a drugs test us open champion svetlana kuznetsova has tested positive for a banned drug according to belgian authorities. belgian sports minister claude eerdekens said that the russian world number five tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine on december. kuznetsova was playing in an exhibition event in charleroi at the time. eerdekens said: there is a problem. ephedrine was discovered. she remains innocent until proved guilty. she can ask for it to be tested again. the situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the world anti-doping agency (wada) the international tennis federation (itf) or the women s tennis accosiation (wta). the test was carried out by regional belgian authorities and kuznetsova has not yet been able to have a b sample tested. speaking at the australian open on monday before eerdekens identified her kuznetsova said: i m not worried. i m not using anything to push myself. i have not been notified of any positive test and i think it is unfair that it s come out the way it did. eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last friday to the player s address in spain as well as to the belgian prosecutors office and the belgian and russian tennis federations. he conceded kuznetsova might have taken a medicine which contained the banned substance. we have simply stated a fact he said. it is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after a procedure that respects the defence. either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection. however kuznetsova s naming was condemned by russian tennis chief shamil tarpishchev. first of all this belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing without any basic evidence tarpishchev said. we all know the basic principle in doping cases. if there is a positive sample then they should notify the international tennis federation (itf) as well as the national federation within three days he said. this is not the case here. as of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials nor did the itf. today i called the itf headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it. if wada (the world anti-doping agency) was behind the testing then we would also have known something by now. otherwise all these looks to me as pure fiction and fabrication of the facts.

1268,remote control rifle range debuts soon you could go hunting via the net. a texas company is considering letting web users use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer antelope and wild pigs. for a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a -hectare texas ranch. the live-shot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet. john underwood the man behind the live-shot website said the idea for the remote-control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site. we were looking at a beautiful white-tail buck and my friend said if you just had a gun for that . a little light bulb went off in my head mr underwood told the reuters news agency. a year s work and $ has resulted in a remote-controlled rig on which sits a camera and . calibre rifle. mr underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals. also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunters can quickly track and aim at passing game animals with the camera and rifle rig. each remote hunting session will cost $ with additional fees for meat processing and taxidermy work. species that can be shot will include barbary corsican and mouflon sheep blackbuck antelope and wild pigs. already the live-shot site lets people shoot rounds at paper and silhouette targets for $. for each -minute shooting session. for further fees users can get the target they shot and a dvd recording of their session. handlers oversee each shooting session and can stop the gun being fired if it is being aimed off-range or at something it should not be. mr underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to texas. in a statement the rspca said it had grave concerns about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle. we assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a clean kill something the rspca accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport it said. animals hit but not killed would without doubt be caused to suffer unnecessarily said the statement. mike berger wildlife director of the texas parks and wildlife department said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting. he said state laws on hunting only covered regulated animals such as native deer and bird species. as such there was nothing to stop mr underwood letting people hunt unregulated imported animals and wild pigs. mr underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals.

923,deutsche attacks yukos case german investment bank deutsche bank has challenged the right of yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the us. in a court filing on tuesday it said the russian oil giant has few texas ties beyond bank accounts and a texas-based finance chief. deutsche bank claimed yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset. it had wanted to help fund gazprom s plans for a $ (£.) bid for yukos unit yuganskneftegas. deutsche bank would have earned large fees from the deal which could not be carried out because us chapter bankruptcy rules made the kremlin s auction of yuganskneftegas on december illegal under us law. but the us bankruptcy court judge in texas granted yukos an injunction that barred gazprom and its lenders from taking part. yuganskneftegas will ultimately end up with gazprom. the winning bidder at the auction was a previously unknown firm baikal finance group which was snapped up days later by rosneft a russian oil firm that is in the process of merging with gazprom. the effect of these transactions is to renationalise yuganskneftegas. deutsche bank contends yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the december auction of its top unit by the russian government which was in a tax dispute with yukos. this blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case deutsche bank said in its court filing. mike lake a spokesman for yukos lawyers said on tuesday that the company stands by its legal action. yukos is confident of its right to us bankruptcy protection and we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again he said. yukos has said it intends to seek $ in damages from the buyer of yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through. in its filing deutsche bank said houston was a jurisdiction in which yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations. it also said the us bankruptcy court should not become involved in a tax dispute between the federation and one of its corporate citizens . it suggested the european court or an international arbitration tribunal were more appropriate jurisdictions for the legal fight between russia and yukos. the next hearing in the bankruptcy is expected on january. analysts believe the tax dispute between the russian government and yukos is partly driven by russian president vladimir putin s hostility hostility to the political ambitions of ex-yukos boss mikhail khordokovsky. mr khodorkovsky is in jail and on trial for fraud and tax evasion.
718,apple attacked over sources row civil liberties group the electronic frontier foundation (eff) has joined a legal fight between three us online journalists and apple. apple wants the reporters to reveal sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products including the mac mini. the eff representing the reporters has asked california s superior court to stop apple pursuing the sources. it argues that the journalists are protected by the american constitution. the eff says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press. apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named asteroid and has asked the journalists e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that. rather than confronting the issue of reporter s privilege head-on apple is going to the journalist s isps for his e-mails said eff lawyer kurt opsahl. this undermines a fundamental first amendment right that protects all reporters. if the court lets apple get away with this and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news analysis and commentary he said. the case began in december when apple asked a local californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites appleinsider.com and powerpage.org. apple also sent requested information from the nfox.com the internet service provider of powerpage s publisher jason o-grady. as well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines. the eff has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with apple including professor tom goldstein former dean of the journalism school at the university of california and dan gillmor a well-known silicon valley journalist. apple was not immediately available for comment.
1065,bellamy under new fire newcastle boss graeme souness has reopened his dispute with craig bellamy after claiming the welshman was not good enough for the magpies. bellamy left newcastle to join celtic on loan after a major row with souness. souness - who refused to refer to the -year-old by name - said bellamy did not score enough goals the chap that s just gone has scored . goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those weren t even in the top flight said souness. that s not good enough for a striker at a club like this. we need to have two strikers who are near goals on a regular basis. bellamy turned down a move to birmingham in favour of joining celtic after a disagreement about the welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated. earlier in the week souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after bellamy accused him of lying. there are certain things you can forgive and forget said souness. but if i d been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job i have after newcastle. he could then return to st james park - and he says that he wants to. however it would seem unlikely he will play for newcastle again as long as souness remains in charge.

827,brown outlines third term vision gordon brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of new labour s next general election bid. he said ensuring every child in britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the nhs s creation. the chancellor has previously planned the party s election strategy but this time the role will be filled by alan milburn - a key ally of tony blair. the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labour s campaign and praised his handling of the economy. writing in the guardian newspaper mr brown outlined his view of the direction new labour should be taking. as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear labour s ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education good health and sustainable communities. bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr brown s article was a warning shot to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. it was as always coded and careful... but entirely deliberate was mr marr s assessment. the prime minister was asked about mr brown s article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio s today programme. mr blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor s role would be central . mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was in part because of mr brown s management of the economy. and he pledged childcare would be a centrepiece of labour s manifesto. he also predicted the next general election will be a tough tough fight for new labour. but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about may. mr blair said he was taking nothing for granted ahead of the vote - warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour s majority instead of hoping for an outright win.

252,ukip candidate suspended in probe eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. john houston was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views including the return of the british empire were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be made available to law-abiding members of the community and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said: we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire. the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations which they are uniquely able to do. mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party s manifesto but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. he told bbc news: he appears to have said these things. we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. it is simply a distraction from the task in hand the eu constitution not individual idiocies. mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying: i feel ukip have over-reacted and overshot the runway. peter nielson who is ukip scotland chairman said he had suspended mr houston on friday night. he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken. he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party. he added: i can t comment too much at the moment i have one version from him but i haven t seen the papers yet.

644,rings of steel combat net attacks gambling is hugely popular especially with tech-savvy criminals. many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk s biggest net firms to stop these attacks. increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures. net firms are realising that it s not just about anti-virus and firewalls said paul king chief security architect at cisco. there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres. mr king said the only way to properly combat these so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king. this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale. malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with megabytes of data over short periods of time. bigger attacks sending down megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said. it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said. so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagrave. however he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days. the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites. it s about understanding what s genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said. we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that s when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capella. this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood. typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets. many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail. most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult. often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen. the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail said ms capella. we ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning. once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. energis took a similar approach said mr seagrave. we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave. also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target. we have people in places where they shouldn t be monitoring tech sites he said. sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy. you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagrave.
801,ireland - england ireland consigned england to their third straight six nations defeat with a stirring victory at lansdowne road. a second-half try from captain brian o driscoll and points from ronan o gara kept ireland on track for their first grand slam since . england scored first through martin corry but had tries from mark cueto and josh lewsey disallowed. andy robinson s men have now lost nine of their last matches since the world cup final. the defeat also heralded england s worst run in the championship since . ireland last won the title then the five nations in but years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with wales. and eddie o sullivan s side banished the ghosts of when england were rampant - victors in claiming the grand slam at lansdowne road. in front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in dublin ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when o gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal. england took their time to settle but their first real venture into ireland s half produced a simple score for corry. the number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the irish line racing yards to touch down. england fly-half charlie hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left but almost immediately o gara winning his cap answered with two penalties in quick succession. england were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after minutes and hodgson the villain at twickenham coolly bisected the posts. the first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking but it was ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. a series of probes led by the talismanic o driscoll back from hamstring injury resulted in a penalty but ireland chose to kick for touch. from the line-out the ball was recycled back to o gara who stroked his second drop-goal this time off the right upright. as the interval approached wing josh lewsey was the catalyst for england s most promising attack. the wasps star raced up his touchline and hodgson s cross-kick put in mark cueto for an apparent score but the sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. england began the second half well and had ireland pinned in their own half. but another english indiscretion on a rare irish break-out awarded o gara a kick at goal which he missed. england s pressure continued and a wave of attacks saw centre jamie noon dragged down yards from the line before hodgson landed a drop-goal. the lead was shortlived however. ireland raced upfield deft handling from the backs including a clever dummy from geordan murphy on hodgson ending with o driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. o gara missed a penalty which would have put ireland nine points clear and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when hodgson s cross-kick was fumbled by lock ben kay near the line. anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high but o gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. inside the last minutes england poured forward spurred on by scrum-half matt dawson who replaced leicester s harry ellis. but despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the tv replay by referee jonathan kaplan - england were unable to pull off a face-saving win. ireland next face france at lansdowne road in two weeks time before the potential title decider against wales in cardiff. england are still to meet italy at twickenham in what is now a wooden spoon decider and scotland. g murphy; g dempsey b o driscoll s horgan d hickie; r o gara p stringer; r corrigan s byrne j hayes; m o kelly p o connell; s easterby j o connor a foley. f sheahan m horan d o callaghan e miller g easterby d humphreys k maggs. j robinson (capt); m cueto j noon o barkley j lewsey; c hodgson h ellis; g rowntree s thompson m stevens; d grewcock b kay; j worsley l moody m corry. a titterrell d bell s borthwick a hazell m dawson a goode o smith.

1694,brown names march for budget chancellor gordon brown will deliver his budget to the house of commons on march the treasury has announced. the budget likely to be the last before the general election will be at about gmt on that wednesday just after prime minister s question time. the annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government s taxation and broader economic predictions. the tories say it is likely the budget will contain measures to attract votes. the election is expected on may. next month s budget will be mr brown s ninth since labour came to power in . if a may election is called there could be as little as days between the budget and the announcement of a date for the election. a shortened finance bill would have to be rushed through parliament with all-party support to allow the government to continue collecting revenue. the full finance bill with the budget measures in it would then be returned to the commons after the election if labour secures another term in office. tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin said: we can be sure of two things: the budget will contain measures to attract votes and it will not contain the £ billion of tax rises which independent experts say are inevitable if labour wins the election. as mr brown announced the budget date in a short ministerial statement accountancy firm ernst & young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy. in the budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and in many cases taxes were increased soon after the election result said aidan o carroll e&y s uk head of tax.
1823,qantas considers offshore option australian airline qantas could transfer as many as jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs according to newspaper reports. chief executive geoff dixon was quoted by the australian newspaper as saying the carrier could no longer afford to remain all-australian . unions criticised the possible move - which may affect cabin and maintenance staff - saying qantas was profitable. more than % of the airline s staff are based in australia. qantas confirmed it was looking at whether it might recruit and source products overseas - potentially through joint ventures - but said it would continue to create jobs in australia. despite making a record australian dollars ($) profit last year qantas has argued that it needs to make considerable savings if it is to remain competitive. we re going to have to get the lowest cost structure we can and that willmean sourcing things more and more from overseas the newspaper quoted qantas chief executive geoff dixon as saying. early this year qantas increased the number of flight attendants based in london from to . if qantas were to follow the lead of other airlines moving staff offshore jobs could shift overseas the newspaper reported. in a statement qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas. however it stressed this would not result in large scale redundancies in its home market where most of its staff are employed. we are totally committed to continuing to grow jobs in australia mr dixon said. we are however operating in a global market and there is no room for complacency simply because we are currently profitable and successful. unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure arguing that qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action. we could understand if qantas was a struggling airline about to go under michael mijatov international division secretary of the flight attendants association told agence france presse. qantas announced a record profit last year and is on course this year for an even greater profit so it is totally unnecessary. in an effort to meet the challenge posed by low cost carriers qantas sought a tie-up with air new zealand last year however the deal was thrown out by the new zealand high court on competition grounds.

1772,athens memories soar above lows well it s goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens. obviously there s no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe. but i want to remind you of a few more events that made another year to remember - or forget - for athletics. one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly s success in the . winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the would be a bit of a formality. kelly had been full of should i shouldn t i thoughts about going for the double in athens. i thought why wouldn t you do the it s your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story. the victory for the british men s relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games. i think the four of them - jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake. hicham el guerrouj s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly s on a global scale. he was the first man since for years to win both the and titles. as soon as he had added the crown and i had finished commentating i jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories. hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good. what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood. dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the five days later was not wise. that was her heart and not her head reacting. paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day. things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained. and if even the smallest thing doesn t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. the positive thing to take from paula s olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me. purely as a race paula s victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenya s susan chepkemei and you don t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability . and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out. kelly and the boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team. we should be concerned that we re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level. the only individual men s finalist on the track was michael east in the . i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and that s where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. dani barnes came fourth in the and she was the highest finisher for team gb. the thing is if we don t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn t look good for the beijing olympics and beyond. i tell you what i really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march. in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve. so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special. to be honest i m getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco. i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on. having said that i m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while. the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.
1633,call for kenteris to be cleared kostas kenteris lawyer has called for the doping charges against the greek sprinter to be dropped. gregory ioannidis has submitted new evidence to a greek athletics tribunal which he claims proves the former olympic champion has no case to answer. kenteris and compatriot katerina thanou were given provisional suspensions in december for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. the greek tribunal is expected to give its verdict early next week. kenteris and thanou withdrew from the athens olympics last august after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. they were also alleged to have avoided tests in tel aviv and chicago before the games. but ioannidis said: everything overwhelmingly shows that the charges should be dropped. ioannidis also said he has presented evidence that will throw a different light on the events leading up to the pair s sensational withdrawal from the athens games. the lawyer added that he has proof the authorities knew kenteris was in germany at the time he was alleged to have missed a test in chicago. nick davies spokesman for athletics ruling body the iaaf which handed out the provisional bans said: we can t comment because we were not present at the hearing and don t know what was said behind closed doors. we expect a verdict from the greek athletics federation before the end of february and will obviously be making a statement then. kenteris won gold at the sydney olympics while thanou won silver in the .

606,court mulls file-sharing future judges at the us supreme court have been hearing evidence for and against file-sharing networks. the court will decide whether producers of file-sharing software can ultimately be held responsible for copyright infringement. they questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue file-sharers could deter innovation. they also said that file-trading firms had some responsibility for inducing people to piracy. the lawsuit brought by of the world s largest entertainment firms has raged for several years. legal experts agree that if the supreme court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue file-trading firms into bankruptcy. but if the judge rules that grokster and morpheus - the file-sharers at the centre of the case - are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of file-sharing providers. instead they would have to pursue individuals who use peer-to-peer networks to get their hands on free music and movies. the hi-tech and entertainment industries have been divided on the issue. intel filed a document with the supreme court earlier this month in defence of grokster and others despite misgivings about some aspects of the file-sharing community. it summed up the attitude of many tech firms in its submission which states that its products are essentially tools that like any other tools capable of being used by consumers and businesses for unlawful purposes . asking firms to second-guess the uses that its technologies would be put to and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use would stifle innovation it said. the electronic frontier foundation a civil rights watchdog is also defending streamcast networks the company behind the morpheus file-sharing software. the case raises a question of critical importance at the border between copyright and innovation it said. it cites as do many the landmark ruling in which found that sony should not be held responsible for the fact that its betamax video recorder could be used for piracy. defenders remain optimistic that the judges will rule in favour of the peer-to-peer networks upholding the precedent set by the sony betamax case. a small band of supporters were outside the court as the lawyers entered wearing save betamax t-shirts. the betamax principles stand as the magna carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the us over the past years said gary shapiro chief executive of the consumer electronics association. supreme court justice stephen breyer said that inventions from printing to apple s ipod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted materials but had on balance been beneficial to society. he said that while file-trading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music conceptually the technology had some really excellent uses . based on tuesday s hearing it seems unlikely that the betamax ruling will be overturned but file-sharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy. grokster s lawyer argued that the company should be judged by its current behaviour rather than what it did when it first set up. but this argument was dismissed as ridiculous by justice david souter. cea boss mr shapiro thinks the case is the most important that the supreme court will hear this year. it s about preserving america s proud history of technological innovation and protecting the ability of consumers to access and utilise technology he said. the case has already been heard by two lower courts and both found in favour of the peer-to-peer networks. they ruled that despite being used to distribute millions of illegal songs file-sharing could also be used to cheaply distribute software government documents and promotional copies of music.
1574,games deserve a place in class computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom say researchers. academics from the institute of education at london university found that games literacy was a key skill for youngsters. as well as being used in different areas of the curriculum games are a legitimate area of study in their own right researchers say. pupils should also be able to create their own games they say. like all games computer and video games entertain while promoting social development and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people s lives said project manager caroline pelletier. games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation just like writing or drawing she said. the researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning. researchers found that girls were often excluded from the male-dominated world of game playing. without first-hand experience of how much fun a game can be they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity said research fellow diane carr. the second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them. sixth-form teacher barney oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film tv and popular music at the a-level course he runs at long road sixth form college in cambridge. for parents the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment could cause controversy. dr andrew burn associate director of the institute of education s centre for the study of children youth and media moved to reassure anxious parents. games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film television and literature do he said. but we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games. the games industry welcomed the report saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children. at a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently said roger bennett director general of the entertainment and leisure software publishers association. this report is further evidence if it were needed about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming. they have much to offer to the education of our children and they have much to offer as a career. the three-year research project which is being presented at a seminar on tuesday in london was partly funded by the department of trade and industry.
1983,officials respond in court row australian tennis top official has defended the australian open courts at melbourne park after criticism of the playing surface by lleyton hewitt. hewitt said he had had a gutful of trying to persuade them to make the surface faster but tennis australia s geoff pollard rejected his comments. we did ask for it to be made faster than last year and to my knowledge it is faster he said. we spent a substantial amount of money on modifications to make it faster. hewitt who has not got past the fourth round at melbourne in seven attempts had earlier said the surface was not worthy of such a prestigious tournament. but he said he would play on whatever surface he had to in order to have a chance of winning. the tournament starts on january and pollard said the surface had been speeded up since last year s tournament following complaints by several australian players. but he refused to accept that the melbourne surface may have had a bearing on hewitt s performances over the years. lleyton s proving how versatile he is on all surfaces he said. it is faster than last year and that ll be faster than the one lleyton beat roger federer on in the davis cup in .
1189,call for action on internet scam phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet rogue-dialling scams according to premium phone line regulator icstis. it has received complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users knowledge. phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. they must warn people earlier about possible fraud icstis said. people who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. without realising a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. icstis spokesman rob dwight said: phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. if my bill goes over the usual £ a month i want to know about it straight away - i don t want to be told when it s hit £. phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic he said. we alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers he added. telecoms ombudsman elizabeth france said: certainly i would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if i do something out of the ordinary. so i would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach. the biggest phone company bt says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because under the current system once the call has been made there s little that can be done. gavin patterson group managing director for bt consumer said we do look at customer s calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. we re looking at the moment at whether we can improve this. but as bt handled million calls a day monitoring was quite a task in itself he added. the government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. at the moment it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down. i use free anti-virus software (avg) and free firewall protection (zonealarm). both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter s love of music sites. how about isps informing all customers of such facilities the responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues. ignorance is and always has been an expensive business. does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised the phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently so are these people followed up and prosecuted these diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal porn and pirated software. if people didn t visit such sites they d be considerably less at risk. whatever happened to personal responsibility it seems everyone has to be a victim these days! part of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. a secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user s knowledge. these scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. they should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going why don t bt et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer s request to anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. after you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions they cannot insist on you paying the bill. to do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. no customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills. disable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. you would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your pc stop blaming the phone companies - it s not their fault! i was very impressed with our phone company recently. i had kept ringing a hotline number for kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if i was aware there were -odd calls to the same number. great service. and i got the tickets as well! i have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. he informed the phone company about it they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. three months later another huge bill of over £ came in - the block apparently didn t work and he still has to pay for it even though a block was in place. phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill otherwise they d be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem. i have been scammed of £. the operator will do nothing about this and to add insult to injury i was charged vat by the government. premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. one example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. the telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly. i know people who have run up large bills despite being it-literate. from talking to bt in belfast i believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. it s not the fault of phone companies and at last they are doing something about it. it s about time that the profiteering by the legitimate phone companies came to an end mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly. i haven t fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam but i think you re seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. in most cases the user is entirely at fault which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them. my telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £ to £ to £. this was because of the scam. they simply billed me. what particularly galls me over and above having over £ stolen is that the supplier and the government (through vat) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses. how about an automatic monthly cap of say £ on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted that way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. at least any disputed amount would be limited far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £ than it is £. a few years back i was also the target of such scams but thank god i have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all i heard was the sound of an attempted connection. how about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date that should prevent the vast majority of these scams.
2188,mexicans tracking unhappy juninho mexican outfit red sharks veracruz hope to sign juninho if the brazilian decides to leave celtic frustrated at his lack of first-team action. their president gustavo parente sanchez says juninho does not wish to remain in scottish football anymore . agent brian hassell insists that the -year-old brazilian midfielder is determined to win back his place. but if the manager is not going to pick him that s a different ball game he told the sun. that s something we d have to look at. juninho deserves respect. he is not a little kid. hassell warns that juninho could reconsider his future at celtic unless he is given a run of games by the end of the january transfer window. juninho was signed from middlesbrough during the summer but he has failed to live up to high expectations and has lost his place to -year-old aiden mcgeady. he has caps for brazil and he s the best signing celtic ever made insisted hassell. he wants to play for martin o neill but does martin o neill want to play him juninho is not someone who has come through the celtic ranks. he deserves much more respect. sanchez is bullish about his hopes of prising juninho from the scottish champions although hassell believes mexico would not be his preferred destination. we have already spoken with juninho and he said if he has no firm offer from a club in spain veracruz will be his destination sanchez told his club s official website. celtic manager o neill is no respecter of reputations. the onus is on juninho to force his way into the team he said. players get a game on merit. that s the way it has always been and that is certainly the case at celtic park.
449,nasdaq planning $-share sale the owner of the technology-dominated nasdaq stock index plans to sell shares to the public and list itself on the market it operates. according to a registration document filed with the securities and exchange commission nasdaq stock market plans to raise $ (£) from the sale. some observers see this as another step closer to a full public listing. however nasdaq an icon of the technology boom recently poured cold water on those suggestions. the company first sold shares in private placements during and . it technically went public in when the stock started trading on the otc bulletin board which lists equities that trade only occasionally. nasdaq will not make money from the sale only investors who bought shares in the private placings the filing documents said. the nasdaq is made up shares in technology firms and other companies with high growth potential. it was the most potent symbol of the internet and telecoms boom nose-diving after the bubble burst. a recovery in the fortunes of tech giants such as intel and dot.com survivors such as amazon has helped revive its fortunes.
747,us ahold suppliers face charges us prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping dutch retailer ahold inflate earnings by more than $ (£). the charges have been brought against individuals as well as companies alleging they created false accounts. ahold hit the headlines in february after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its us subsidiary foodservice. three former ahold top executives last year agreed to settle fraud charges. ahold has admitted that it fraudulently inflated promotional allowances at foodservice improperly consolidated joint ventures and also committed other accounting errors and irregularities. the nine now charged who worked as suppliers to ahold are accused of signing false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the retailer for promoting their products in its stores. food companies pay supermarkets and retailers for prime shelf space. the suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid providing auditors with signed letters that allowed ahold to inflate its earnings. us attorney david kelley said he expects the nine vendors will plead guilty to the charges. he added that there may be more court actions in the future. i don t want to leave you with the impression that these were the only ones involved he said. among those facing charges are john nettle a former employee of general mills; mark bailin of rymer international seafood; tim daly of michael foods and kenneth bowman who worked as an independent contractor for total foods. others include michael hannigan of sugar foods; peter marion of maritime seafood processors and first choice foods; gordon redgate of commodity manager and private label distribution; bruce robinson of basic american foods and michael rogers formerly of tyson foods. pasquale d amuro of the fbi called the nine vendors the key ingredients in the process of cooking the books at ahold. at the time of the scandal ahold was seen by many as europe s enron. ahold shares tumbled on the news and many market observers predicted that the fall out could damage investor confidence across europe. it was less severe than many had envisaged however and since then ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its reputation and investor confidence. ahold is the world s fourth-largest supermarket chain. its other us businesses include stop & shop and giant food.
552,the memory driving brown s mission the memory gordon brown says keeps returning to him - the one that he says is burnt into him - is that of a year-old girl whose parents died of aids and who is hiv positive herself. mr brown seems haunted by her eyes desolate of all hope. and then he talks of those eyes that do inspire optimism: an extraordinary performance by schoolgirls of kenya s largest slum advancing with crowded menace flicking their hips in a manner almost as disturbing before the finale of a clenched fist salute and shout of free education - free education for all . mr brown s message generally that compassion must become action before that hope is squandered. but he is such a pivotal figure in british politics it is almost impossible not to ask him why he is doing this. his answer in part is because of the missionaries that used to come to his father s church. ever since he says africa has been important to him. i ve absolutely no doubt whatsoever this is heartfelt. but he also believes it is time for the world to see a new gordon brown. not the dull reassuring bank manager but a man driven by a moral passion - and it just so happens the labour party feels an awful lot happier ridding the world of debt than ridding the world of dictators. there s also a sense of liberation. if mr blair won t allow him to run the election campaign then he can at least pretend it was all getting tedious and he d much rather be out examining social problems in the raw. it also goes some way to solving one of the overarching problems for all politicians of all parties: scepticism sliding into cynicism about politics itself. if he can help the world s poor just a little then it shows politics isn t worthless. but is his vision for africa too grand can poverty in the continent really be halved brown replies that no one thought the berlin wall would ever come down either. he s still got to overcome - not only the reluctance of other finance ministers in the world - but also the cynicism of experts who wonder whether debt relief will just be squandered by governments that just won t in the end spend wisely.
1455,lib dems target first-time buyers the liberal democrats have unveiled plans to build new affordable homes on publicly owned land. the party s scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust as a way of getting onto the housing ladder. the lib dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites. labour has already announced plans to help first-time buyers and the tories would extend right-to-buy schemes. all the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run-up to the election after a survey suggested first-time buyers could not afford a home in % of uk towns. the lib dems say their mutual homes would let people buy a share of a property usually worth about % of the building costs. party leader charles kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land donated by central or local government. people would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land he added. they would spend about % of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property. when they moved house they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share. it would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account. mr kennedy said: mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually investing only as much as they can afford. there are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities. the kind of golden share used by the lib dems in south shropshire could be rolled out more widely. under the plan councils secure deals with developers where they keep a % share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market. instead they are sold at build cost to people who the local council decides have local needs. the party says its help for first-time buyers can be funded at no extra cost to the taxpayer. but the plans involve changing the vat system which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings. the conservatives claimed the plans would amount to an extra tax of up to £ on every new house. this is typical of lib dem hypocrisy said tory shadow local government secretary caroline spelman. they claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market. the flagship tory proposal on housing policy is to give a million more housing association tenants the right to buy their homes. labour has said it will allow council and housing association tenants to buy a share in their homes. housing minister keith hill said much of the lib dem plans mimicked the government s strategy. however as usual the lib dems proposals are completely uncosted he said. mr hill said he also asked whether the lib dems would match labour s promise to spend £ on making refurbishing and repair council homes by .
811,bp surges ahead on high oil price oil giant bp has announced a % rise in annual profits to $. (£.) on the back of record oil prices. last week rival shell reported an annual profit of $. - a record profit for a uk-listed company. bp added that it was increasing its fourth-quarter dividend by % to . cents and that it would continue with share buybacks. bp chief executive lord browne said the results were strong both operationally and financially. the company is earning about $. an hour. despite the record annual profits figure bp s performance was below the expectations of some city analysts. however bp s share price rose or nearly % in morning trading to . its profit rise for the year included profits of $. (£.) for the final three months of - up from $. a year ago but below its third quarter. speaking on the bbc s today programme on tuesday lord browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone. the profits are up more than the price of oil is up he said. lord browne pointed out that bp was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration. we have spent many years buying (assets) when the price is low he said. the company has made new discoveries in egypt the gulf of mexico and angola. however lord browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his company s huge profits saying that in the north sea it paid progressively more tax the more profits it made. lord browne believes oil prices will remain quite high. currently above $ a barrel he said: the price of oil will be well supported above $ a barrel for the medium term. bp put production for the year at . billion barrels of oil up % on but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for.
547,ink helps drive democracy in asia the kyrgyz republic a small mountainous state of the former soviet republic is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country s elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting. this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population. in an effort to live up to its reputation in the as an island of democracy the kyrgyz president askar akaev pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision. the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid- with a hastily pushed through referendum in reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with deputies. the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the german embassy the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes. the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated. the ink is sprayed on a person s left thumb. it dries and is not visible under normal light. however the presence of ultraviolet light (of the kind used to verify money) causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light. at the entrance to each polling station one election official will scan voter s fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. likewise any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot. these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors - the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics notably ukraine and georgia. the use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government. widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep - a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society. the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems. others such as the aggressively middle of the road coalition of non-governmental organizations have lauded the move as an important step forward. this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world in countries as varied as serbia south africa indonesia and turkey. the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in afghanistan showed improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems. the use of invisible ink is not without its own problems. in most elections numerous rumors have spread about it. in serbia for example both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion. other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink - various soft drinks solvents and cleaning products are put forward. however in reality the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off. the ink stays on the finger for at least hours and for up to a week. the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills. the passage of the inking law is nevertheless a clear step forward towards free and fair elections. the country s widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for february. david mikosz works for the ifes an international non-profit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies.
191,the ticking budget facing the us the budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george w bush are highly controversial. the washington-based economic policy institute which tends to be critical of the president looks at possible fault lines. us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. without major changes in current policies and political prejudices the federal budget simply cannot hold together. news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs. from the standpoint of the big fiscal trends the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come. under direct threat will be the federal government s ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund. as soon as the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits. the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt which will grow in years by conservative estimates to more than half the nation s total annual output. this upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. even now a growing share of us borrowing is from abroad. the us government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of japan and china among other nations. this does not bode well for us influence in the world. the decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. the dollar is already sinking. before too long credit markets are likely to react and interest rates will creep upwards. that will be the shock. interest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as housing automobiles other consumer durables agriculture and small business. some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late . there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget. the public outcry will force congress to act. whether it will act wisely is another matter. how did this happen by definition the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn t adequately capture the current situation. federal revenues are at levels while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher. in addition the united states has two significant military missions. the bush administration s chosen remedy is the least feasible one. reducing domestic spending or eliminating waste fraud and abuse is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. indeed if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way there would hardly be any such spending left. law enforcement space exploration environmental clean-up economic development the small business administration housing veterans benefits aid to state and local governments would all but disappear. it s fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. the biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security) and health care for the elderly and the poor. to some extent increases in these areas are inevitable. the us population is aging and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. but serious savings can only be found where the big money is. savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system public and private. brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation s elderly and indigent. on the revenue side the lion s share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since will have to be replaced. some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes. finally blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. there is no good reason to fixate on it anyway. moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense. the sooner we face that reality the sooner workable reforms can be pursued. first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts. second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years much of it unrelated to afghanistan iraq or terrorism. third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform. one thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century.
38,debate needed on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet the elections watchdog has said. fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £ cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. there were almost £ in reported donations to political parties in and with nearly £ of them from individual gifts worth more than £. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible says its report. if there was to be a cap it should be £ - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £ in donations between and . even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £ so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters. the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates while cutting national spending limits from £ to £. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said: there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations. he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.

804,yachvili savours france comeback france scrum-half dimitri yachvili praised his team after they fought back to beat england - in the six nations clash at twickenham. yachvili kicked all of france s points as they staged a second-half revival. we didn t play last week against scotland and we didn t play in the first half against england he said. but we re very proud to beat england at twickenham. we were just defending in the first half and we said we had to put them under pressure. we did well. yachvili admitted erratic kicking from england s charlie hodgson and olly barkley who missed six penalties and a drop goal chance between them had been decisive. i know what it s like with kicking. when you miss some it s very hard mentally but it went well for us he said. france captain fabien pelous insisted his side never doubted they could secure their first win against england at twickenham since . france were - down at half-time but pelous said: no-one was down at half-time we were still confident. we said we only had points against us which was not much. the plan was to keep hold of possession and pressure england to losing their composure. france coach bernard laporte accepted his side had not played well. we know we have to play better to defend the title he said. i m not happy we didn t score a try but we re happy because we won.
706,ireland - argentina an injury-time dropped goal by ronan o gara stole victory for ireland from underneath the noses of argentina at lansdowne road on saturday. o gara kicked all of ireland s points with two dropped goals and five penalties to give the home side a % record in their autumn internationals. an impressive argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. the pumas shocked the irish early on with a try from federico aramburu and felipe contepomi kicked points. the well-drilled and sharper pumas out-played and out-thought ireland in the early stages. indiscipline allowed argentina s leinster fly-half contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. he was on the mark again two minutes later when argentina shocked a ragged ireland with the first try of the game. ireland turned the ball over and manuel contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner aramburu to sprint in under the posts. o gara finally got ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. playing into a strong wind and rain ireland continued to come second best in tight situations and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. o gara managed to land his second penalty in the minute but once again contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. the second-half started as the first had ended. o gara rifled over another penalty in the minute but contepomi matched it three minutes later. the upper-body strength of the pumas never allowed ireland to take control up front while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. ireland had to rely on o gara s boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. the munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from metres - to bring his team to within four points with minutes on the clock remaining. and ireland s chance came when argentina s number eight gonzalo longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. o gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. but ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow o gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous if fortuitous comeback.
1381,millions to miss out on the net by % of the uk s population will still be without internet access at home says a study. around million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to million or % of the uk who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is wishful thinking the report concludes. the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access it predicts. the gap between have-nets and have-nots has been much talked about but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark the report suggests. internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it said adrian hosford director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits said mr hosford. as now the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families the older generation and the disabled. those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots the disabled will make up % and the elderly nearly a third by the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome he said. if we don t address this problem now it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs education opportunities will be limited and they ll simply not be able to keep up with society he said. the alliance for digital inclusion an independent body with members drawn from government industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.
522,mobiles double up as bus tickets mobiles could soon double up as travel cards with nokia planning to try out a wireless ticket system on german buses. early next year travellers in the city of hanau near frankfurt will be able to pay for tickets by passing their phone over a smart-card reader already installed on the buses. passengers will need to own a nokia handset which will have a special shell attached to it. the system would reduce queues and make travelling easier said nokia. transport systems around the world are seeing the advantage of using ticketless smartcards. using a mobile phone is the next step said gerhard romen head of market development at nokia. the ticketless trial will start early in and people will also be able to access transport information and timetables via their phones. nokia has worked with electronics giant philips to develop a shell for the mobile phone that will be compatible with hanau s existing ticketing system. the system opens up possibilities for mobile devices to be interact with everyday environments said mr romen. it could be used in shops to get product information at bus-stops to get information about the next bus or for example by being passed over an advert of a rock star to find out details of concerts or get ringtones he told the bbc news website. he is confident that the trial being run in germany could be extended to transport systems in other countries. the technology offers access to a lot of services and makes it easy to get the information you want he said.

1301,short attacks us over tsunami aid former cabinet minister clare short has criticised the us-led tsunami aid coalition saying the un should be leading efforts. president bush has announced that an alliance of the us india australia and japan will co-ordinate a humanitarian drive. but ms short said the effect of the parallel coalition would be to undermine the un. she said only the un had the moral authority to lead the relief work. ms short resigned as international development secretary over the iraq war. i think this initiative from america to set up four countries claiming to co-ordinate sounds like yet another attempt to undermine the un when it is the best system we have got and the one that needs building up she said. only really the un can do that job she told bbc radio four s pm programme. it is the only body that has the moral authority. but it can only do it well if it is backed up by the authority of the great powers. ms short said the countries involved could not boast good records on their response to major disasters. the us was very bad at coordinating with anyone and india had its own problems ms short said. i don t know what that is about but it sounds very much i am afraid like the us trying to have a separate operation and not work with the rest of the world through the un system she added.
2,tigers wary of farrell gamble leicester say they will not be rushed into making a bid for andy farrell should the great britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes. we and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage tigers boss john wells told bbc radio leicester. at the moment there are still a lot of unknowns about andy farrell not least his medical situation. whoever does take him on is going to take a big big gamble. farrell who has had persistent knee problems had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months. leicester and saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing farrell if he decides to move to the -man game. if he does move across to union wells believes he would better off playing in the backs at least initially. i m sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre said wells. i think england would prefer him to progress to a position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards. the jury is out on whether he can cross that divide. at this club the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in a ready-made replacement.
676,ukraine steel sell-off illegal the controversial sell-off of a ukrainian steel mill to a relative of the former president was illegal a court has ruled. the mill krivorizhstal was sold in june for $ (£) - well below other offers. president viktor yushchenko elected in december is planning to revisit many of ukraine s recent privatisations. krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration. on wednesday prime minister yulia tymoshenko said as many as firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed. mr yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to - enterprises. more than businesses in all from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts have been sold off since as the command economy built up when ukraine was part of the soviet union was dismantled. analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list so as to preserve investor confidence. thursday s ruling by a district court in perchesk overturned a previous decision in a lower court permitting the sale. the consortium which won the auction for the mill was created by viktor pinchuk son-in-law of former-president leonid kuchma and rinat akhmetov the country s richest man. the next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether opening the way for krivorizhstal to be resold. mr yushchenko has suggested a fair valuation could be as much as $. one of the foreign bidders who lost out steel giant lnm told bbc news that it would be interested in any renewed sale.
192,blair said he would stand down tony blair promised gordon brown he would stand down before the next election a new book about the chancellor claims. but the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the cabinet according to the book. the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other. the book brown s britain said tony blair felt by november he had lost voters trust. the author s sources all unnamed allies of mr blair and mr brown said the prime minister felt the iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party. the book serialised in the sunday telegraph alleges that mr blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy pm john prescott in november of his intention to stand down. at that stage he saw gordon brown and said look you are the next most influential member of the government i need your help to get through the next year mr peston said. i myself recognise that i m going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and i will then stand down. but he changed his mind in june following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him the book claims. mr peston told bbc news: my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. what the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust mutual animosity. i think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private i don t think the relationship is good because brown understandably feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership. there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently following their separate responses to the asian tsunami. rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold mr blair s monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new marshall plan for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster. former welfare minister frank field mp criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on gmtv s sunday programme. what sort of model does it give to the nation when the two most important political leaders do nothing but fight it out together or use their aides to fight it out the labour mp for birkenhead asked. he said the prime minister should sack mr brown but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so. conservative policy co-ordinator david cameron mp for witney added: if it wasn t so serious it would be funny. but it is serious - you ve got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime poverty or dirty hospitals - they are fighting each other. carol walker bbc news political correspondent added: there is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign. and clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster.

76,yukos sues four firms for $ russian oil firm yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year s forced state auction of its key oil production unit yuganskneftegas. yukos is claiming more than $ (£) in damages after yugansk was sold in december to settle back taxes. the four companies named in the law suit are gas giant gazprom its unit gazpromneft investment company baikal and state oil firm rosneft. yukos submitted the suit in houston where it filed for bankruptcy. as well as suing for damages yukos has asked the us court to send its tax dispute with the russian government to an international arbitrator. it also has submitted a reorganisation plan as part of its chapter bankruptcy filing. the clash between yukos and the kremlin came to a head last year when yukos was hit with a bill of more than $ in back taxes and unpaid fines. to settle the bill russia forced yukos to sell off yuganskneftegas. yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the us in an effort to regain control of the oil production business. it also has vowed to use all legal means at its disposal to go after any firm that tries to buy or take control of its assets. earlier this month it sued the russian government for $.. analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies while moscow officials have dismissed yukos legal wrangling as meaningless. in houston bankruptcy judge letitia clark will start a two-day hearing on february to hear arguments on whether a us court is the proper forum for the case. the threat of legal action from yukos and its bankruptcy filing in houston did have an effect on last year s auction however. concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle gazprom and gazpromneft withdrew from the auction and yuganskneftegas was sold to little-known investment firm baikal finance group. a few days later baikal gave control of the company to state-run oil group rosneft for $.. rosneft meanwhile has agreed to merge with gazprom bringing a large chunk of russia s very profitable oil business back under state control. yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky once russia s richest man is in prison having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.

1144,mcdonald s to sponsor mtv show mcdonald s the world s largest restaurant chain is to sponsor a programme on music channel mtv as part of its latest youth market promotion. the show advance warning highlights new talent and mtv reckons it will give mcdonald s access to nearly million homes in countries. mcdonald s golden arches name and i m loving it catchphrase will be used throughout the half-hour programme. the move comes amid growing concerns about obesity in europe and the us. the european union has called on the food industry to reduce the number of adverts aimed at young children warning that legislation would be introduced. unless voluntary steps were taken. in the us food group kraft is among firms that already have cut back on promoting sugar and fattening products to the young. mcdonalds has also been taking steps to improve its junk food reputation revamping its menu and providing clients with health-related products such as pedometers. as well as burgers like the big mac and quarter pounder with cheese the company now sells healthier options such as salads and fresh fruit. chief executive jim skinner attributed an .% increase in january worldwide sales to the vitality of our menu among other things. hooking up with mtv is expected to add extra momentum to mcdonald s recent revival. mtv which played a key role in the emergence of the music video is to show advance warning on all of its channels across the world. the programme can at present only been seen in the us where it has featured artists like british stars joss stone and franz ferdinand. mcdonald s has targeted the youth market in the past with its advertisements signing up stars like jelly-legged dancer justin timberlake and all-woman singing group destiny s child.
408,terror powers expose tyranny the lord chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and british terrorist suspects under house arrest where there isn t enough evidence to put them on trial. lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties. but thriller writer frederick forsyth tells bbc news of his personal response to the move. there is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of britain. or so says home secretary charles clarke. my reaction so what it is not that i am cynical or just do not care. i care about this country very much. but in the years that i have been alive there has not been one hour of one day of one month of one year when there has not been a threat aimed at us. my point is the british have always coped without becoming a dictatorship. we have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat. but that is what the blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-qaeda tyranny. i was born on august . the mortal threat back then was a scruffy little austrian called adolf hitler. a week after my first birthday the threat had become reality. we were at war. my father wore a uniform for five years. after we yearned for peace at last. but in winston churchill told us - from the baltic to the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across europe. behind the iron curtain another genocidal psychopath another threat. josef stalin triggered the cold war with the berlin blockade in . my whole generation was blighted by it. we were threatened by the nuclear holocaust the nuclear wind the nuclear winter. we built shelters that would have sheltered nothing. we spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals. we took silly precautions. some fought it; some marched futilely against it. some pretended it was not there. the cold war lasted years but we remained a parliamentary democracy. by the early seventies it was terrorism as well. al fatah black september red brigades but most of all for us the ira and the inla. thirty more years; policemen and women over soldiers more than civilians dead but we won because even ira bombs could not force us to become a tyranny. that was why the tyrants lost. civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible. evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources; yes and one judge no-jury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised. informants had to be given immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle. but habeas corpus did not die; right of appeal was not abolished. now the threat is islamic fundamentalism. its leaders want to destroy our society; so did the ira. it is based and funded abroad; so was the ira. it has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the ira. it is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents; so was the ira. the prime movers are not easy to bring to trial; neither were the ira. but we did. and without becoming a tyranny. now the blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism. the citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge but the whim of a political activist called a government minister. to be protected from terror the government says we must become a tyranny. but a tyranny is based on the citizen s terror. this is not victory; this is defeat before a shot is fired. an interesting article - its good to see widening participation in the debate - but i suggest we move one step further. our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace because invading foreign nations imprisoning the innocent and hunting in the shadows cannot destroy an evil of the mind and hatred within the heart. rather than focusing upon effect we should consider the cause because terrorism does not begin with bombs. why not try a foreign policy of compassion it can only enhance our democracy and share our freedom. i agree with frederick forsyth. we really can t deal with terrorism by turning britain into a fascist state. what we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians. if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial there probably isn t any. our security services behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it while the real villain gets away. remember there were no wmd in iraq. just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist. in this overly politically correct society it is good to see someone like mr. forsyth speak out. yes there has been oppression by the british government in the past and overstepping the mark in places like ireland but yes we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc. (apart from a number of prisoners in belmarsh goal for example).this country signs up to human rights and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear the innocent people (defined by whom ). when id cards become mandatory the data collected will not be protected by the data protection act and will be readily available to people like gchq with no control by the person whose id is being checked. the threat now is new. you cannot compare the threats of past years with now. forsyth says died over years or terrorism; people died in one morning in ny on september . the threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology. a kilo of semtex will flatten a building a kilo of plutonium will flatten a city. you now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible. i agree the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too. the problem with this issue is not that it isn t important but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times that we will just let this go without telling the government no. however as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too far. as somebody of chinese origin i can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life. whilst life wasn t perfect we could make better for ourselves. now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do. we have to be politically-correct and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions. we have a prime minister who spends too much time meddling in us politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of british citizens at home or abroad. mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions. let s hope the bbc doesn t get gagged for letting people express their views. the people have the right to know and the bbc s role is to inform educate and entertain... i agree. terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties. in the end the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy. the terrorists have already won. i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth. yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate. the idea that the new terrorism demands new powers is erroneous. the evidence of any real terrorist capability in the uk is scant. ricin for example is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction. what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear. if the government has its way with id cards tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not. we will have lost the precious freedom which bush and blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others. i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth. i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court. that goes right back to magna carta and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they knew best . when you look at today s britain you realise george orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date. frederick forsyth puts it beautifully. the government is seeking to introduce a police state. the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases together with the un-british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of years. we are sleep-walking into this. wake up! an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: ) if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance. these people will use devastating force against us without fear of any consequence. ) the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it. because these terrorists are potentially so deadly we have to come up with new tougher responses. it will be a little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london has been nuked. we won t have much of a society left to debate ! he s correct in most of what he says. mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in northern ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young catholics to join the ira. administrative detention of muslims could have a similar effect now. surely we the public would be better protected if the security services rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long )they were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack. i don t usually have much time for mr forsyth s largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on. there is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the u.k. but it is very doubtful whether al-qaeda is a global organisation co-ordinating this. the rise of surveillance cameras id cards the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times this is the stuff of nightmares. add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the home secretary and i genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit. where will this end. as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u.k. it s government will soon have it s people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs. mr forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation but could not verbalise. thank you. mr forsyth seems to forget that killings in the troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides. he also forgets basic human rights were suspended then as now. experienced judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times. for very little return and maximum alienation. these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the same. forsyth is wrong. the nature of the current threat is new. it is no longer to our armed forces as the soviet threat in the eastern bloc was. it is to you and i. the terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately. the best comparison is therefore the blitz . at this time let us not forget suspects (foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war without any complaints from the public. we must not forget we are at war. i d say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major uk target is a when not an if probability. i ll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didn t do enough to protect the uk. people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair. i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth. the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live is under attack not from terrorists but from this government. the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the alleged terrorists are doing but from our own government. i believe what this government is doing is at the very least highly questionable and at worst sinister. at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the british isles; when we are all tagged and monitored constantly our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing. it should be of great concern to everyone. i am slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him. i am against a police state and would not like to think that i lived in one. i think that the attack on iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism. how true. there are extremely worrying parallels between britain now and germany during the s. i never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from within. mr forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler stalin and the ira all failed. as a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not. that does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort. but to meet the new threat to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today s terrorists we may need to do things a little differently. let us hope not. frederic forsythe s comments seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole and britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear. it is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end and terrorists can come in all forms as mr. forsythe s opening comments suggest. i am reminded of a quote attributed to thomas jefferson. a nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neither. the government are faced with an incredibly difficult task and have made a policy to deal with it. it s all very well criticising that policy but if mr forsythe can t draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative i say so what to his opinions. frederick forsyth s rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable. he distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against new labour. this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights. it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist because he does not appreciate the need for balance. i rarely find myself agreeing with my forsyth but in this instance i think he is correct. the rule of law must prevail civil liberties are worth defending. if the government can hold suspects without charge or trial what s next i agree absolutely. by introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror. our democratic system is not perfect but as churchill points out it is better than all the others that have been tried . terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom. i do not usually agree with mr. forsyth but he is spot on here. the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose. totalitarianism always requires an outside threat justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want. the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation. although in principle i agree with him frederick forsyth fails to address one key point- al-qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the uk) seek to kill the maximum number of people. the ira wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement. yes i agree with mr. forsyth s views. i do not believe the government s plans are justified. there is over reaction to and the negative influence of the us president s interpretation of democracy and freedom. he uses the same arguments that were current before the wwii the wars to liberate iraq afghanistan with syria and iran to come. we are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generations. mr forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs. the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests. sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who mr. forsyth seems to be putting along side the scruffy little austrian. thomas hobbes would be smiling in his grave at labour s propositions. like new labour he called himself a libertarian. like new labour he believed he was promoting the people s best interests. but as forsythe criticises this government hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians. simply put he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty - the liberty to live - man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign as protection against his fellow barbaric man. hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity and rightly so. i hope new labour suffers the same treatment. i agree with mr forsyth s views. the governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracy. they must not be allowed to get away with it. of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he s wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny. has he forgotten about shoot to kill torture internment without trial collusion with loyalist death squads etc my background is somewhat similar to freddie s so i am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments. we can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms. whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive it is unfortunately also the first step towards totalitarianism. who is to decide whom is a suspect why should we believe them who can have faith in the honesty integrity and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years what is to stop false denunciations what of those falsely accused who will lose their careers who will support their families will their children still go to school it smacks to me of the methods of nazi germany stalin s russia ceausescu s romania - the list goes on. it looks as if a new dark age is coming. i see that opinion on mr forsyth s remarks are divided. the problem i see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family only to people they don t like or are scared of. but history has shown that if you have laws like that they always get abused by those in power. after all today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you! and that day you ll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice. our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces you have to be shown to be deserving of it. if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period we are no better that those we are fighting. i never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by frederick forsyth but i m in wholehearted agreement with him on this one. we as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda which of course also means we ll inherit most if not all of their total paranoia and allow our governments of any political persuasion incidentally to gradually and insidiously impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods. i grieve for the future of my children it s no wonder they re adamant they don t ever want any of their own. this government with much fanfare signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial. this puts it on a par with the government of burma. like many of your respondents i wouldn t usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share but in the instance of opposing charles clark s proposals for house arrest i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth/ i agree with mr forsyth. just look at the facts - our government (along with the us) invaded another sovereign country (iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it s case based on fear. the facts turned out to be very different. if individuals are treated in the same distorted way then we ve done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs. we become animals too. i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent it is hypocrisy of the highest order. mr forsyth links islamic fundamentalism to the new threat . however it appears that he has misunderstood the term islamic fundamentalism . it should be pointed out that a muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the qur aan and the teachings of the last prophet muhammad is an islamic fundamentalist. this person does not commit suicide in any shape or form nor does she/he kill innocent women men and children. this person is self-reflective and constantly tries to better her/his actions by being good to others. the people who mr forsyth labels the new threat are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam. they have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions. on top of that they claim to be following islam in its true form! i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in northern ireland internment certainly didn t achieve anything - the bombings didn t stop and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british. being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london it is easy to agree with him he is absolutely spot on. during the ira bombings there were massive explosions in canary wharf to the right of where i write this and also to the left in the city of london. notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on prime minister thatcher in brighton and on later occupants of downing street there was no retaliatory blitz on belfast or dublin as there has been on afghanistan and iraq. even when england was in true peril in apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like. we have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including id cards which winston churchill decided had to go since he said the average bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities (incidentally i can still remember my old id card number). hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered. what can i add to mr. forsyth s eloquently put arguments... except applause! well done that man for standing up and being counted in the war against tyranny .
833,wenger offers mutu hope arsenal boss arsene wenger would consider signing adrian mutu once the striker has served his drugs ban. mutu was sacked by chelsea on friday after testing positive for cocaine - a move wenger has backed. but he said: i don t even wonder if that could happen because i think he will be suspended for a long period. but once he has served his suspension he has the right again to start from zero. i would then meet the player and see what he tells me. mutu faces a ban of between six months and two years when the football association decides on his punishment. chelsea decided to act before his case was heard and sacked the striker on grounds of gross misconduct after it was revealed that he had failed a drug test. but mutu has hit out at the club s decision saying: chelsea have destroyed me. he told the sunday mirror: i don t know what i m going to do. i am shocked and surprised by their decision. i didn t expect them to pay me while i was suspended but i never thought they would sack me either. why didn t they wait to do this now my career is in ruins. i might as well walk away from football. what is there left for me chelsea have been criticised for their stance with the professional footballers association accusing the club of failing in their duty of care to the player. and mutu agreed adding: it is unfair. if they were going to sack me they should have done it afterwards. why did they go public to make an example of me it makes it very difficult for me now.

2022,us data sparks inflation worries wholesale prices in the us rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in january according to government data. new figures show the labor department producer price index (ppi) rose by .% - in line with forecasts. but core producer prices which exclude food and energy costs surged by .% the biggest rise since december increasing inflationary concerns. in contrast the university of michigan barometer of us retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. the university s index of consumer spending fell to . in early february from . in january which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the us public. the mixed set of data on friday led to volatile early wall street trade as the dow jones standard and poor s and nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory. the economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the federal reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. the fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since june in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control. mr greenspan told congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. the ppi would argue for greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace said joe quinlan chief market stategist at bank of america capital management. but this michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that. consumer spending accounts for % of us economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy which is why the michigan data is closely observed. however on friday it was overshadowed by the core ppi core figure which surged .% during the past months the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. the concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core ppi as an impetus for the fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates said paul cherney chief market analyst at standard & poor s. but ian shepherdson chief us economist at high frequency economics said the ppi report was much less alarming than at first glance. one-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices which are no indication of broad ppi pressure were responsible for the increase he said. prices for autos and trucks also jumped in january but shepherdson said it is a good bet these increases won t stick .

2108,taxes must be trusted - kennedy public trust in taxes is breaking down because labour and tories are not being straight with people on the issue lib dem leader charles kennedy has said. a day ahead of the government s pre-budget report mr kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to painful economic realities . he said the current level of taxation was about right although he would put a new % tax on top earners. other parties have accused the lib dems of making uncosted promises. mr kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation. the lib dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and wednesday s speech did not announce new policies. speaking at the commonwealth club mr kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver. he said. budgets have to add up. tough choices are needed in public spending. the lib dems would cut low priority spending including the government s id cards scheme and the child trust fund. those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over- putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks he said. the lib dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a rise on income tax. now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new % tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down. there would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the polluter who pays . the lib dems say the tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while labour has hidden most of its tax rises. mr kennedy said: that contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans. with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down. he challenged the treasury to open up its books so the national audit office can report on the government s performance. conservative co-chairman liam fox said: liam fox said if charles kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their spending commitments. the reality is the lib dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy and the only people who would face tough choices would be the families who would be £ worse off a year. and chancellor gordon brown said the lib dem figures did not add up. he accused the party of claiming it would spend less while across the country committing itself to spend more.
2037,bmw reveals new models pipeline bmw is preparing to enter the market for car-style people carriers the firm s chief has told bbc news. speaking at a bmw event ahead of the geneva motor show helmut panke predicted demand for such crossover vehicles would soar in europe. in contrast he said the popularity of van-style seven-seat vehicles and traditional saloon cars would fade. customers are moving out of the mini-van (and) traditional concepts are not as attractive anymore he said. we have decided that bmw will enter the [crossover] segment he said in the clearest indication yet about the car maker s intentions. mr panke praised the honda accura as the best execution yet of a crossover vehicle. we have decided that the bmw brand will enter the segment he said. a decision on just how bmw will manage its entry into the new market is due in the first half of . typically it takes about three years from when a decision is taken before a new model hits the streets mr panke said implying that a bmw crossover could be on the market by . the coming switch is driven in part by the need for successful carmakers to stay aware of trans-atlantic differences in the car market mr panke insisted. while in the us drivers tend to prefer sports utility vehicles (suvs) such as the bmw and its sibling in europe demand for crossover vehicles is likely to be considerable mr panke said. there s a growing market here he said. we are going to go that way.
2056,student inequality exposed teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas a report says. the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between and . but the percentage of poorer students hardly changed at all said its chief executive sir howard newby. increasingly more women than men went to university while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference. the hefce report drawing on child benefits data said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than % chance of going to university while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was %. participation at constituency level ranged from % in kensington and chelsea % in the city of london and westminster and % in sheffield hallam down to % in bristol south and leeds central and % in nottingham north and sheffield brightside. sir howard said the report highlighted the entrenched divisions between rich and poor areas but added it was a social as much as an educational problem. he told bbc news: we know once children from deprived backgrounds get into university they do very well. in fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds. the issue is i think one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people. he said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils between the ages of and it was too late. instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier even down to primary school level to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to he said. but while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge there were some encouraging findings he added. tuition fees and student loans in england and wales - and the different fee regime in scotland - did not seem to have affected the choices of young people even the poorest. the report also showed women were % more likely than men to enter higher education in - up from % in . in the poorest areas the gap was % in women s favour and growing faster than anywhere else. the higher education minister kim howells said: we are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas. higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education. from upfront tuition fees in england would be removed with grants for the less well off. the shadow education secretary tim collins said: it is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education. tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access. the group which represents university vice-chancellors universities uk said the new system of deferred fees in england due to start in with grants and bursaries for poorer students would encourage more of them to go into higher education. the national union of students argued the opposite - that the situation was likely to get much worse with poorer students being restricted in choice and having to make decisions based on their financial situation rather than aspiration . the tables below show the participation rate for each parliamentary constituency in britain:

1357,bond game fails to shake or stir for gaming fans the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left owners glued to their consoles for many an hour. adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original s massive sense of fun. this however is not a sequel nor does it relate to the goldeneye film. you are the eponymous renegade spy an agent who deserts to the bond world s extensive ranks of criminal masterminds after being deemed too brutal for . your new commander-in-chief is the portly auric goldfinger last seen in but happily running around bent on world domination. with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turner s similarly-titled theme song the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury which enables a degree of x-ray vision. rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments squashed by a plummeting helicopter. the notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a game but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to. recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair invention and glamour of the film franchise. this title lacks that aura and when the bond magic shines through it feels like a lucky accident. the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough. quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination. admittedly the competition has been tough even in recent weeks with the likes of halo and half life triumphing in virtually every department. what the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy dynamic scenes of violent chaos. as is the trend of late you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter. sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos meaning that frustration is often the outcome. and irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed. a minute red dot passes for a crosshair although the collision-detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for. shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky and you will not always know you have picked them off since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations. it is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker s allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights - no time is risked with a measured build-up. by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no goldfinger hat-fiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion. there is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains and it is a testament to the power of the bond universe that they can cut such a dash. but the in-game niggles combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought-through will make this a disappointment for most. diehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings. the game is weak not completely unplayable. then again fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras. given james bond s healthy pedigree in past games there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip a commendable idea that just has not worked that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return. goldeneye: rogue agent is out now

1239,greer attacks bully big brother germaine greer has criticised celebrity big brother s bullying of housemates after quitting the reality tv show. she said superior bullying tactics like making housemates cold and hungry could encourage playground bullying. she also condemned the complete irresponsibility of adding brigitte nielsen s former mother-in-law jackie stallone to the house on monday. nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children greer said. the feminist writer and broadcaster said big brother had behaved like a child rather than a parent by taunting contestant john mccririck after denying him a cola drink. i thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground greer said. she also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking agendas . i had no idea who would be in here and it s wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are. media observers had been surprised by greer s initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the channel reality tv show given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. as she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: i m leaving over specific issues but best for everyone if i don t discuss them. i have a problem with decisions i make them fast and when i make them i stick to them. greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against big brother. other celebrities to walk out of a reality show tv include sex pistol john lydon former eastenders actress danniella westbrook and ex- singer brian harvey who all left i m a celebrity... get me out of here. previous big brother housemates to leave before their time were sunita sharma and sandy cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show. vote was germaine greer right to leave celebrity big brother yes no results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion happy mondays dancer bez is now - favourite to win the show followed by blazin squad singer kenzie at - and actor jeremy edwards at -. ladbrokes spokesman warren lush said that the series was still wide open adding that the last hours had also seen a rush of bets on mccririck slashing his odds to -. dj lisa i anson is the outsider with odds of - while jackie stallone who joined the house on monday is also one of the less popular housemates at -. the first eviction of the series has now been postponed after greer s exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. the eight remaining contestants are competing for a £ prize to be donated to the charity of their choice if they survive a series of public votes. for every vote cast by viewers by telephone or text during the programme s run will go to a tsunami charity appeal.

831,muslims discuss election concerns issues that muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by uk community representatives. the event is being held by the muslim association of britain (mab) which believes muslim voters could influence the result in up to constituencies. last year mab which opposed the war in iraq urged muslims not to vote for labour in the european elections. but a spokesman stressed the meeting was not necessarily anti-labour . this meeting is not anti-party in particular it s anti-policy it s on the issues we are going to ask muslims to vote on mab spokesman dr azzam tamimi said of tuesday s event. there are issues of concern to muslims and muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues. dr tamimi said the main issues muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on iraq the palestinian situation the erosion of civil liberties for muslims in the uk and economic social and education problems. approximately . of the uk s . muslims are of voting age. previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted labour but more recent studies have suggested labour support has been falling away significantly among some muslim voters. anger over the war in iraq has appeared to be the main reason with many saying it was unjustified . representatives from a number of muslim organisations will attend tuesday s event. among them will be the muslim council of britain (mcb). the chairman of the mcb s public affairs committee sher khan said the war in iraq would be a significant factor affecting muslims voting intentions. i think it s going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact mr khan said. however professor john curtice of the university of strathclyde is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by muslims could make. for the most part the labour constituencies where there s a large muslim community are relatively safe but there are one or two that are not quite so safe professor curtice said. the constituencies where labour was most at risk from a muslim tactical vote were bethnal green in east london and rochdale in lancashire he added. in bethnal green former labour mp george galloway who founded the anti-war party respect is standing against sitting mp oona king who had a -vote majority in . in rochdale the liberal democrats - the mainstream party a icm survey showed was benefiting most from muslim disaffection with labour - secured second place in the election securing just under votes fewer than labour s lorna fitzsimons. but professor curtice said the muslim anti-war vote could be split between the liberal democrats and respect meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box. ironically the tories might be the beneficiaries if labour does lose seats which is generally the case he said. but dr tamimi said mab s intention was not to empower the tories. we know the next government will be labour but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the muslims use their vote properly. if the next labour government has a reduced majority that s a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country dr tamimi said.
822,johnny depp: the acting outlaw johnny depp whose latest role was peter pan creator jm barrie in finding neverland is celebrated as one of hollywood s most maverick talents. depp has become an unlikely major star given his preference for taking dark and idiosyncratic roles instead of surefire box office hits. he has had a long-running working relationship with the equally unconventional director tim burton. depp was born in kentucky in and at first wanted to be a rock star playing in a number of bands and supporting acts such as iggy pop and the b- in florida. on a visit to los angeles his former wife introduced him to actor nicolas cage. in he started his film career playing a doomed teenager in horror film nightmare on elm street. two years later he played a soldier in oliver stone s vietnam epic platoon. but it was tv that first made depp a star. he played undercover cop tommy hanson in the us series jump street for three years from . in he began his partnership with burton in the dark fairy tale edward scissorhands about a young man with blades for hands. he won plaudits in for the downbeat film what s eating gilbert grape where he played a sensitive youth looking after an overweight mother and a retarded younger brother played by leonardo dicaprio. another role under burton ed wood starred depp as the crazed cult film-maker wood in . he played a much more serious sensitive role in his next major film donnie brasco where he portrayed an undercover cop infiltrating a mafia ring. in he directed his only film to date - the brave the story of an indian man offered money to appear in a snuff film. two years later he played hunter s thompson in terry gilliam s ambitious but poorly-received big screen adaptation of fear and loathing in las vegas. he worked again with tim burton in the horror film sleepy hollow and appeared opposite dame judi dench and juliette binoche in chocolat. his performance in pirates of the caribbean which earned him golden globe and bafta nominations had many critics thinking he based it upon the mannerisms of his friend rolling stones guitarist keith richards. his latest role in finding neverland explored jm barrie s relationship with sylvia (kate winslet) and her children. depp s charismatic performance drew an audience of adults and children alike into barrie s vivid imagination and he was called the fifth child of the group by the film s director marc forster. he has two children of his own with french singer vanessa paradis having previously been in a long-term relationship with british model kate moss. the theme of children s literature in depp s career - and his long association with tim burton - are set to continue in his next role playing willy wonka in a remake of roald dahl s classic charlie and the chocolate factory. british tv comedy fans might also remember depp s guest role in the final episode of bbc sketch programme the fast show cited as his favourite show. it was another surprise move in depp s varied and intriguing career.
329,blair up for it ahead of poll tony blair says his personal standing in the eyes of voters will be an issue in the general election. the prime minister said he was up for it as the country waits to go to the polls possibly in a matter of weeks. he told the observer government life was a constant barrage of attack but said he would not stay in charge if he felt unable to contribute. mr blair also spoke of meeting many people across the country with concerns about the compensation culture. he said britain was in danger of needless panic over public safety issues. speaking amid a flurry of pre-election campaigning the prime minister said: i am an issue i always will be. whoever is the prime minister will be. he added: if you are afraid to take criticism you should go and do another job. asked if he would quit as leader if he felt like a liability to labour he said: it s important always not to do the job unless you feel you have something to contribute. whether he still had something to offer he said was a judgement for people to make. mr blair s assessment is likely to be seen as a signal that replacing him would not bring an upsurge in fortunes for the labour administration. his comments come as the co-chairman of the conservative party liam fox on saturday called him a disappointment of historic proportions as a prime minister. mr blair said he had learned from a series of at times tough encounters with members of the public during question and answer sessions across the country in recent weeks. he pledged to clamp down on britain s growing compensation culture which has brought concerns that doctors teachers and other professionals are being hampered in their work by the fear of frivolous lawsuits. i was quite shocked to be told by people who were running a nursery that they were worried about letting the kids out into the playground when it was wet in case one of them slipped and fell and they ended up having a legal case [against them] he said. we have got to look at a way of getting people protection on that. mr blair said the government was also looking at how to make sure that legal aid is not abused with actions against doctors and others as part of a review being carried out by the lord chancellor s department. and there should be real debate about the risk posed by public safety threats he said. we are in danger of - depending on whatever is the media campaign of the day - ending up spending literally hundreds sometimes millions of pounds meeting quite a small risk. his comments come after the government announced it is to spend £ on drugs to treat a possible outbreak of bird flu and the sudan food scare. meanwhile commons leader peter hain has warned that on the campaign trail he has seen dangerous complacency being displayed by labour voters convinced of a general election victory. if labour voters stayed at home in marginal seats they could see tory leader michael howard coming in the back door to number with the tradesman s key to number getting into power he added.

613,student fee factor played down a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland. however lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out. applications from england and wales rose by % between january and the previous year up to . fears had been expressed that a flood of fee refugees would try to avoid top-up fees of up to £ a year being introduced in england. in june last year mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by £ in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood although no figure has yet been agreed. legislation to introduce the top-up fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all. the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas. universities scotland which represents university principals claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out. director david caldwell said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities but this was not a major factor. he told bbc radio scotland s good morning scotland programme: the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study. they know that when they take up their studies in they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated. however it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here. mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances the number was not huge - an additional figure of about . also the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales where there are no plans for top-up fees have also risen by %. mr wallace said: accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held not just in britain. we want to make sure that when students are making their choice they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland. we do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option. very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.
1081,finnan says irish can win group steve finnan believes the republic of ireland can qualify directly for the world cup finals. after saturday s superb display in the draw in paris ireland face minnows the faroe islands in dublin on wednesday. the versatile finnan who starred against the french is confident the group is ireland s for the taking. there is a chance for us now to go on win our home games and why not win the group even though it s a tough one said the liverpool player. switzerland ireland france and israel are all now tied on five points from three matches - although the republic look to have a slight edge after claiming away draws in basel and paris. in basel we did not play great football but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game. in paris we looked good throughout the team and a point was the least we deserved because we had a number of chances. looking back we had an opportunity to get the three points but we are happy with a point and that will give us confidence going into wednesday s game. on paper we have got the toughest matches out of the way and we have set standards for ourselves. automatic qualification is there. it would certainly be good to avoid a play-off but on the back of a couple of good results i don t see why we can t win the group. manager brian kerr was keen to mention the contribution of stephen carr and finnan on ireland s right flank at the stade de france. finnan s normal position is right-back but he looked assured in a more advanced position against the french. as i play on the right for my club and being a natural right-back it was something he (kerr) looked at because france play strongly down the left-hand side. so i was happy to play and stephen carr and i enjoyed the game particularly as the defence and midfield held together well and nullified their attacks.

1987,tories unveil quango blitz plans plans to abolish quangos have been unveiled by the conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut. six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than £.. among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities. tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive. the plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government. the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people rather than officials run hospitals and surgeries. announcing the plans mr redwood said: mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers and has broken the pledges he made. far from improving public services spending taxpayers money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats more regulation and higher taxes. his party leader michael howard argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending. labour are creating two britains: the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain he said. in the real world people are working harder just to stand still. they ve seen their pensions knocked for six. they re being squeezed by extra taxes. the forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic britain. the government has announced plans to cut civil servants as part of its efficiency drive. but chief secretary to the treasury paul boateng attacked the tory plans. the conservatives are committed to cutting labour s public spending plans by a massive £ billion he said. cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting bureaucracy but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools hospitals and the police. the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.

550,labour accused of broken pledge labour has already broken its pre-election promise on immigration before the ink has dried on its new pledge card the tories have claimed. home secretary charles clarke has been quoted as telling labour members he wants more migrants to come to the uk. tory co-chairman liam fox said the comments were at odds with tony blair s prediction of a net cut in immigration. but mr clarke accused him of trying to score cheap political points by muddling immigration with asylum. london s evening standard quoted mr clarke telling labour activists at a question and answer session in gateshead that he wanted britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny. that s not only a moral duty and a legal duty but something which is part of the essence of this country he said. we want more migration more people come to study and to work. we want more people coming to look for refuge. mr blair s was asked last wednesday if the government s new immigration plans including a point system for economic migrants would reduce net migration. the prime minister told mps: the abusers will be weeded out and as a result of the end of chain migration [where families have an automatic right to settle] the numbers will probably fall. on monday dr fox told reporters: the prime minister has broken his word so many times in the past but now his promises do not even last a week. the labour party election pledges even when they are so incredibly vague do not even last four days. the tories want quotas for economic migrants and refugees and on tuesday will outline more details of their plans for health checks on migrants. mr clarke dismissed the latest tory attack. this is simply a scurrilous attempt by the tories to score cheap political points he said. the tories are purposely mixing together two separate issues of immigration and asylum. mr clarke said he had made clear the uk would welcome genuine economic migrants for key jobs on a strict points based system. and only asylum seekers genuinely fleeing death or persecution would be admitted. under our plans we expect unfounded applications to continue to fall he added. earlier dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about tory policies and then attacking the lies. he told bbc radio: if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war i guess you are going to lie about anything at all. the latest pre-election spats come after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a hard right agenda which would take britain backwards. lib dem leader charles kennedy accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester liverpool leicester somerset basingstoke shrewsbury dorset and torbay.
1175,director nair s vanity project indian film director mira nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make william makepeace thackeray s novel vanity fair - as the book has been a favourite through her life. the book is one of the classics of english literature - the story of scheming century social climber becky sharp played in the film by reese witherspoon. nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film which she has - controversially - made in a bollywood style including two song-and-dance routines in the film s second half. it was serendipity really - i was offered vanity fair by the studio focus features who had distributed monsoon wedding nair told bbc world service s masterpiece programme. they offered me their next-best thing not realising that vanity fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since i was years old in an irish catholic boarding school in india. since her debut feature salaam bombay! - nominated for the best foreign language oscar and winner of best first feature at cannes - nair has become one of india s most famous and respected directors. she is not restricted to bollywood however - she followed salaam bombay! with mississippi masala starring denzel washington and the perez family her first hollywood film. her career peaked with monsoon wedding in which won the golden lion award at venice. nair s indian-style adaptation of vanity fair however has been attacked by critics in the us - where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week - who described the bollywood elements as jarring. the film has a new ending with becky sharp running off for a new life in india. but nair said that her film had picked up on the way thackeray - who was born in india but moved to england as a young man - had seen the world. first when i was it was becky sharp who is a completely memorable character because i recognised myself in her - i recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies who wanted to buck the system that they were in she said. but it was the sort of novel i somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years and i would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again. as i got older and read it i think it was thackeray s clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society the fact that he was born in india but came to england as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider and yet he was an insider. that perspective was something i really loved. nair also defended her decision to cast an american actress - reese witherspoon - as becky sharp despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are british or irish. i cast intuitively - in my films i cast as many non-actors as i cast actors she said. for me it is intuition - i have to fall in love with an actor. it is a visceral response. thackeray describes becky sharp as a minx. also she s described as someone who s tiny red-headed and thin. reese had that completely minx-like irresistibility about her. having won the role because she seemed physically perfectly suited to the part however witherspoon then became pregnant. but nair said that though this had created the need for some filming tricks it had in fact also helped the film. it was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when i first met her husband [actor ryan philippe] i said knock her up won t you i need some flesh on the girl she joked. i m not a fan of the underfed los angeles actor at all. this was for me about becky sharp being eventually a full-blown woman through the course of the film. i love the luminosity that pregnancy brings i love the fleshiness i love the ample bosom - it gave me much more to play with. nair explained how camera tricks had been used to disguise witherspoon s bump in various scenes - including hiring a number of young boys in costumes to stand in front of her. she runs she gets off coal carts she jumps off horses - she does everything nair said. but there s also a certain carriage with horses that is going to wipe the screen at a certain moment because of the bump.

1989,hodgson shoulders england blame fly-half charlie hodgson admitted his wayward kicking played a big part in england s - defeat to france. hodgson failed to convert three penalties and also missed a relatively easy drop goal attempt which would have given england a late win. i m very disappointed with the result and with my myself hodgson said. it is very hard to take but it s something i will have to get through and come back stronger. my training s been good but it just didn t happen. hodgson revealed that olly barkley had taken three penalties because they were out of my range but the centre could not convert his opportunities either particularly the drop goal late on. it wasn t a good strike he added. i felt as soon as it hit my boot it had missed. it s very disappointing but i must recover. andy robinson said he would keep working on the kicking with his squad. however the england coach added that he would take some positives from the defeat. we went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have france done he said. they won the game from kicking penalties from our line. it s very frustrating. the lads showed a lot of ambition in the first half they went out to sustain it in the second but couldn t build on it. we took the ball into contact and you know when you do that it is a lottery whether the referee is going to give the penalty to your side or the other side. we have lost a game we should have won. there is a fine line between winning and losing and for the second week we ve been on the wrong side of that line and it hurts. england went in at half-time with a - lead but they failed to score in the second half and dimitri yachvili slotted over four penalties as france overhauled the deficit. england skipper jason robinson admitted his side failed to cope with france s improved second-half display. we controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after half-time he said. we made a lot of mistakes in the second half and they punished us. they took their chances when they came. it s very disappointing. last week we lost by two points now one point.
832,tories pledge free sports lessons children would be offered two hours free sports training a week by a future tory government the party has said. the policy would provide up to £ yearly for local sports clubs in the uk to deliver after-school sport. the extra coaching would be funded by the national lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school. shadow home secretary david davis said five million children were being denied adequate sporting opportunities. the plans would help tackle the fastest growing rate of obesity in the developed world he said. shadow sports minister lord moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy. we aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the sports clubs in the uk. the tories say labour s plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed. government figures show that in england in only a third of schools at key stages and and two-fifths of schools at key stage met that target. the tories also claim that of the £ the prime minister pledged in to invest on school sports facilities only £ had been spent. but the big lottery fund has said that complex capital projects are involved - and it was confident the money would all be allocated by next year as intended.

125,us crude prices surge above $ us crude prices have soared to fresh four-month highs above $ in the us as refinery problems propelled petrol prices to an all-time high. us light sweet crude futures jumped to $. a barrel in new york before closing at $.. the gains tracked a surge in us gasoline futures to a record high of $. a gallon. the jump followed a fire at western refining company s refinery in texas which shut down petrol production. a spokesman for the group was unable to say when the production unit would be back up and running. this market simply wants to go up citigroup global markets analyst kyle cooper told reuters news agency. ed silliere analyst at energy merchant added: gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in texas which means there will be a scramble for product in the (us) gulf coast. elsewhere a refinery in houston was closed due to mechanical problems while on tuesday production at bp s texas city refinery was taken down for a short time. in the approach to spring the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season. the rise in prices came despite a us government report that showed domestic supplies of fuel oil and fuel were rising. meanwhile oil production cartel opec s recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market. oil prices are roughly % higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather the declining value of the dollar and fears that opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand. instability in iraq and underlying fears about terrorism have also played a part in the rally.
1778,water firm suez in argentina row a conflict between the argentine state and water firm aguas argentinas controlled by france s suez is casting doubt on the firm s future. the firm which serves the province of buenos aires wants a tariff rise of % to fund water-supply improvements. the government has rejected the % rise and wants aguas argentinas to make an annual investment of pesos ($; £.) in improvements. planning minister julio de vido has offered state help but not for free . mr de vido said that the argentine state would not make a contribution in the form of a subsidy . he has said a contribution could be made in return for a seat on the company s board. he added that the government is in discussions with aguas argentinas about what role it might take in the event that a state contribution is agreed. however aguas argentinas told the argentine newspaper clarin it would not accept any change to its legal structure and in practice this rules out state participation on its board. the planning minister didn t rule out the possibility of cancelling aguas argentinas water concession. yet he added that he didn t like to do futurology . but last week argentine economic minister roberto lavagna told the french media in paris that the government was considering allowing a % increase in tariffs and the possibility of a state contribution to aguas argentinas infrastructure investments. speaking in buenos aires mr de vido later denied the possibility of any tariff increase and insisted that the annual investment in water infrastructure was at the centre of the discussions. he added that in the coming weeks the future of aguas argentinas would be decided. suez owns % of aguas argentinas (.%) while spain s aguas de barcelona is its second biggest shareholder with .%. recently suez lost a water concession in bolivia after mass protests in the city of el alto (the poorest in the country) with citizens complaining of unfair water charges. this forced the government to cancel the contract. in argentina suez s subsidiary which has been fined for cutting the supply of water during a recent heat wave and allegedly failing to keep up investment to meet the demand for water has maintained a tense relationship with the argentine government. during the last financial crisis in argentina the firm sued the state alleging that converting its tariffs from us dollars to pesos and then freezing them during devaluation had affected the company and made it difficult for it to meet its contractual obligations. when president nestor kirchner of argentina arrived in power he began to negotiate a solution to the disagreements with international utilities operating in argentina. but he has rejected any tariff increases alleging this will impoverish citizens further. he has also asked for more investments to meet the growing demand for water. on may aguas argentinas and the government signed an agreement to renegotiate its buenos aires water-concession contract. the firm agreed to invest pesos. the issue has attracted european interest. last week in paris president kirchner discussed this problem and other issues with french president jacques chirac. the argentine government is also under pressure from european union countries and the international monetary fund (imf) to raise utilities tariffs because most of the utilities operating in argentina are european.
2217,rings of steel combat net attacks gambling is hugely popular especially with tech-savvy criminals. many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk s biggest net firms to stop these attacks. increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures. net firms are realising that it s not just about anti-virus and firewalls said paul king chief security architect at cisco. there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres. mr king said the only way to properly combat these so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king. this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale. malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with megabytes of data over short periods of time. bigger attacks sending down megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said. it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said. so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagrave. however he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days. the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites. it s about understanding what s genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said. we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that s when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capella. this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood. typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets. many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail. most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult. often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen. the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail said ms capella. we ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning. once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. energis took a similar approach said mr seagrave. we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave. also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target. we have people in places where they shouldn t be monitoring tech sites he said. sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy. you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagrave.

951,csa chief who quit still in job the head of the failing child support agency widely reported to have resigned three months ago is still at the helm of the troubled organisation. doug smith s departure was announced by work secretary alan johnson on november as mps grilled him over the agency s poor performance. his resignation was referred to by both tory and lib dem leaders during that day s prime ministers questions. officials now say he did not resign but will move on under civil service rules. mr smith s departure was reported widely at the time as his shouldering the blame for the failings of the child support agency. in january the mps who make up the commons work and pensions committee published a highly critical report into the failing agency noting the chief executive has now left and hoping the new leadership will bring a fresh approach to what is a failing organisation . on that day s today programme mr johnson was asked why mr smith had been allowed to resign rather than be sacked. he replied: the chief executive decided it was time to move on there is a new chief executive coming in. it now emerges that the widespread belief mr smith made commander of the order of the bath in the new year honours had left was wrong. a department for work and pensions spokeswoman confirmed mr smith was still in post and that he would continue in the job until a replacement was found. no date was ever given for doug smith s departure she said adding that the post had been advertised. tory work and pensions spokesman david willetts said families affected by csa failings would wonder why mr smith was still in his job three months after his departure was announced. the csa has been surrounded by controversy since its introduction in to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents. the work and pensions committee launched their inquiry into the csa s performance after it became clear that despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in a backlog of claims was still building up. it is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than £ while a further £ has been designated as unrecoverable . the mps found american it giant eds £ system was nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate . in november when he surprised mps and the watching media by announcing mr smith s departure mr johnson said: i should tell you that doug has decided that now is the time to stand aside and to allow a new chief executive to tackle the challenges ahead. doug has exceeded the four years that senior civil servants are now expected to remain in a particular post. so doug believes that we have reached the natural breakpoint at which he can hand over the reins. lib dem sir archy kirkwood who chairs the commons work and pensions committee said that when mr johnson had announced mr smith was going he got the clear impression the csa chief was retiring though it had since emerged that was not the case and he may be seeking new employment opportunities. he added his committee was duty bound to allow the work and pensions secretary to get new management into place in the csa and it would be premature to say anything further on the issue at the moment. but committee member and tory mp nigel waterson said he was amazed mr smith was still in his job. when mr smith and the secretary of state came to give evidence we were led to believe he was going shortly he said. even if he was working out three months notice he should have been clearing his desk by now. asked on thursday about mr smith s position mr johnson told bbc radio s world at one he thought it was a non-story . he added that he had been absolutely open when he announced mr smith s departure to the select committee and how people chose to interpret it was a different thing . the major issue is have we got a new chief executive coming into this very important agency as quickly as possible and have we gone through the right selection process to make sure we ve got the right people he added.

397,lawyer attacks anti-terror laws a senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government s anti-terror laws says the current system is giving britain a bad name. ian macdonald qc quit when the government failed to recognise a house of lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful. he was part of a -strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists. five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign. mr macdonald told bbc news: the reason why i am resigning is because i fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion. the current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the muslim community in britain and the whole asian community. i think it is giving britain a bad name internationally . under the anti-terrorism crime and security act introduced by the government in in response to the september attacks foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial. but mr macdonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury. my own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury a proper criminal trial with proper accusations. as far as i m concerned the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this. he added. the attorney general lord goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from mr macdonald on monday. according to the independent his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers - nicholas blake qc andrew nicol qc manjit singh gill qc rick scannell and tom de la mare. they are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of special advocates who represent detainees before the special immigration appeals commission (siac) - a secure court without a jury which tries terror suspects. mr macdonald said he had no idea whether further resignations would follow. but barry hugill a spokesman for the campaign group liberty told radio s today programme that more lawyers may go. i can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning he said. they are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in the right to trial by jury has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights. helena kennedy a labour peer and a human rights lawyer said the special advocates main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees. when this whole procedure was being considered immediately after september there was a great deal of argument particularly in the house of lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review she said. without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot as ian mcdonald has said on our legal landscape something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law.
2092,us interest rate rise expected us interest rates are expected to rise for the fifth time since june following the us federal reserve s latest rate-setting meeting later on tuesday. borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to .%. the move comes as a recovery in the us economy the world s biggest shows signs of robustness and sustainability. the dollar s record-breaking decline meanwhile has spooked markets and along with high oil prices has raised concerns about the pace of inflation. we are seeing evidence that inflation is moving higher said ken kim an analyst at stone & mccarthy research. it s not a risk it s actually happening. mr kim added that borrowing costs could rise further. the fed has said that it will move in a measured way to combat price growth and lift interest rates from their -year lows that were prompted by sluggish us and global growth. with the economic picture now looking more rosy the fed has implemented quarter percentage point rises in june august september and november. although the us economy grew at an annual rate of .% in the three months to september analysts warn that fed has to be careful not to move too aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery s sails. earlier this month figures showed that job creation is still weak while consumer confidence is subdued. i think the fed feels it has a fair amount of flexibility said david berson chief economist at fannie mae. while inflation has moved up it hasn t moved up a lot. if economic growth should subside... the fed would feel it has the flexibility to pause in its tightening. but if economic growth picked up and caused core inflation to rise a little more quickly i think the fed would be prepared to tighten more quickly as well.
2186,battered dollar hits another low the dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the us economy. the greenback hit $. in thin new york trade before rallying to $.. the dollar has weakened sharply since september when it traded about $. amid continuing worries over the levels of the us trade and budget deficits. meanwhile france s finance minister has said the world faced economic catastrophe unless the us worked with europe and asia on currency controls. herve gaymard said he would seek action on the issue at the next meeting of countries in february. ministers from european and asian governments have recently called on the us to strengthen the dollar saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies. it s absolutely essential that at the meeting of the our american friends understand that we need coordinated management at the world level said mr gaymard. thursday s new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the us had fallen % in november - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity. commerce department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the us economy - grew just .% last month. the figure was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the .% rise in october. the official us policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters. the us government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from abnormal and dangerous heights set in . the us says it will let market forces determine the dollar s strength rather than intervene directly. statements from president bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin us deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency. but while some observers said the quiet trade on thursday had exacerbated small moves in the market most agree the underlying trend remains downwards. the dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further albeit less dramatic weakening in . i can see it finishing the year around $. and we can see that it s going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in finishing the year around $. said adrian hughes currency strategist with hsbc in london.
201,profits stall at china s lenovo profits at chinese computer firm lenovo have stood still amid slowing demand at home and stiffening competition. the firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the pc division of personal computer pioneer ibm. lenovo s profit for the three months to december was hk$ (us$; £) less than % up on the year before. chinese pc sales have risen by a fifth in each of the past two years but are now growing more slowly. the company is still by far the biggest player in china with more than a quarter of the market. but western firms such as dell and hewlett-packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in china and lenovo s sales were down .% by revenue to hk$.. if the $. agreement lenovo signed with ibm on december goes through it will mark the end of an era. ibm pioneered the desktop pc market in the early although strategic mis-steps helped lose it its early dominance. in any case margins in pc market are now wafer thin and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except direct-sales giant dell. but investors have been less than impressed with lenovo s move designed to take it out of china and further onto the world stage. its shares are down % since the announcement two months ago largely because of the unprofitability of the unit it is buying. there have been rumours that the deal could be in trouble because us government agencies fear it could offer china opportunities for industrial espionage. the reports of the possibility of an investigation into the risk sent lenovo s shares up % in late january.
800,more women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks according to a two-year study. the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus spam and spyware attacks rose by .% each year between and . the study for net security firm preventon shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. it is thought that % of those buying home net security programs are retired. for the last three years that has gone up by an average of .%. but more retired women (%) were buying security software than retired men. the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers. the study predicts that % of all home pc net security buyers will be women in . they could even overtake men as the main buyers by if current rates persist according to the research. i think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their pcs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong said one over- woman who took part in the research. you started off with young male stereotype computer users for last years paul goosens head of preventon told the bbc news website. now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home. but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online particuarly if they are new to broadband he said. programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with a slower connection too said mr goosens. security software should be easy to use with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language he added. the nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses. high-profile complaints about rogue diallers and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti-virus firewall and spyware-removal programs too. without protection these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally. more than pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses a study from security from symantec showed last year. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer according to net security experts. programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs many based in eastern europe over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance. the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because said mr goosens they are reported in the press much more. you are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat. they are asking the right questions he explained. it is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider that they are safe to connect to the net. an unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes. by the end of the year it is thought that more than % of uk homes will have broadband net access. in july last year the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time according to the office of national statistics.
1549,how to make a greener computer the hi-tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware. bill thompson thinks it s about time. my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as i drove around cambridge. now you can t buy petrol with lead additives and we re all better off as a result. chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways. apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic mercury cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents. and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops mobiles and music players. one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle. if you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive. a well-designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost. this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling. they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears. it is as they say about time. we have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage. the car engine is a case in point: lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder a phenomenon called knocking so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere. redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work so it took decades before it was done. we re seeing the same thing in the technology industry and as a result there are billions of devices from old mobile phones to antique handhelds that will have to be recycled in years to come. if apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new mac mini and throwing away their old pc keeping the monitor and other peripherals. even if apple does not get its way four or five-year-old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it s not unreasonable to replace them. but what do we do with the old ones i ve just looked around my office and i find two monitors an old pc two old handhelds three ancient laptops four antique mobile phones a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use. they are all old enough to be hazardous waste - the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead - but it s possible that some of the components could be useful. i could take them up the to the council recycling centre but it s a -mile drive away across town and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best. here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste a box for glass cans and paper that can be recycled and a black bin for the rest. there are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks. would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too i d probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box - at least eventually. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.
1736,us show sued for rat-eating stunt a us tv network is being sued for $. (£.) by a viewer who says he was disgusted by watching contestants eat dead rats in a stunt show. austin aitken is taking action against nbc over its programme fear factor. he said watching the show caused his blood pressure to rise so high that he became dizzy and light-headed. the legal assistant said nbc was sending the wrong message to viewers that cash can make or have people do just about anything beyond reasoning . the hand-written four-page lawsuit said: to have the individuals on the show eat and drink dead rats was crazy and from a viewer s point of view made me throw-up as well as another in the house at the same time. mr aitken who lives in cleveland said that after becoming light-headed he ran towards the bedroom and knocked his head in a doorway. a spokesman for nbc said it had no comment on the lawsuit but confirmed the stunt show did feature a rat-eating scene in new york s times square on november. past shows have featured viewers eating spiders and live worms. the programme has been screened in the uk on sky one.
1259,uk heading wrong way - howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said. britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a bossy interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded: britain is working don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year mr howard said. we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale the speed the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp. yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever. he went on to reflect on the values that most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election he pledged to turn these beliefs into reality and set out the choices he says are facing britain. how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them. the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives undermining enterprise and denying people choice. worst of all it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today. the tories he said can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance the respect for the rule of law the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change. this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months he said urging voters to hold him to account. but labour spokesman mr kemp said: it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on april not january. let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment % interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax. with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government of which he was a member inflicted upon the country.
625,nigeria to boost cocoa production the government of nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme. agriculture minister adamu bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected tonnes this year to tonnes by . the government will pump naira ($.; £ ) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. nigeria is currently the world s fourth-largest cocoa producer. cocoa was the main export product in nigeria during the . but with the coming of oil the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about tonnes a year in . at the launch of the programme in the south-western city of ibadan mr bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. he also announced that naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. the country could be looking to emulate rival ghana which produced a bumper crop last year. however some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. people who are not farming will hijack the subsidy said joshua osagie a cocoa farmer from edo state told reuters. the farmers in the village never see any assistance he added. at the same time as nigeria announced its new initiative ghana - the world s second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. the country saw more than $.-worth of the beans exported during -. analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop pushing production closer to levels seen in the when the country was the world s leading cocoa grower.

280,levy takes whitbread novel prize orange prize winner andrea levy has seen her book small island win the whitbread novel of the year award. she is now favourite to win the overall prize after beating booker winner alan hollinghurst s the line of beauty. geraldine mccaughrean has picked up the children s fiction award for the third time for not the end of the world. all the category winners go through to compete for the whitbread book of the year title which carries with it a £ prize. a panel of judges including sir trevor mcdonald actor hugh grant and writer joanne harris will meet up on january to decide the overall winner with the announcement being made later that evening. bookmaker william hill has placed london-based levy s novel as the / favourite to win. small island levy s fourth novel is set in post-war england and centres on a landlady and her lodgers. one is a jamaican who joined british troops to fight hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in london. the judges who included authors jenny colgan and amanda craig were full of praise for her writing. what could have been a didactic or preachy prospect turns out to hilarious moving humane and eye-popping. it s hard to think of anybody not enjoying it wrote the judges. the first novel section was won by susan fletcher for eve green beating the favourite jonathan strange and mr norrell by susanna clarke. fletcher has recently graduated from graduated from the university of east anglia creative writing course. waterstone s fiction writer buyer suzie doore said: it is great to see susan fletcher win in the first novel category. as a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the whitbread. fresh out of university she is certainly one to watch. in the biography category it was john guy s the life of mary queen of scots that was picked as winner. the judges called it an impressive and readable piece of scholarship which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens . guy has published many histories including tudor england. he is a fellow at clare college cambridge and became a honorary research professor of the university of st andrews in . michael symmons roberts fourth collection of poems scooped the poetry award. his works mixes mysticism erotica and philosophy through life death and resurrection. as well as writing poetry symmons roberts also makes documentary films. children s winner mccaughrean who went into magazine publishing after studying teaching previously won the whitbread prize in with a little lower than angels and in with gold dust. she has previously been the winner of the blue peter book of the year.
585,football manager scores big time for the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager (cm). indeed it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs. however last year was the final time that developers sports interactive (si) and publishers eidos would work together. they decided to go their separate ways and each kept a piece of the franchise. si kept the game s code and database and eidos retained rights to the cm brand and the look and feel of the game. so at the beginning of this year fans faced a new situation. eidos announced the next cm game with a new team to develop it from scratch whilst si developed the existing code further to be released with new publishers sega under the name football manager. so what does this mean well football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series and it has been released earlier than expected. at this point looks like it will ship early next year. but given that football manager is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves how does this new version shape up a game like could blind you with statistics. it has an obscene number of playable leagues an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans. but that does not do justice to the game really. what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth. you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from for instance england and scotland. that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish leagues but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south. of course you might be looking for european glory or to get hold of abramovich s millions in which case you can take control at chelsea or even barcelona real madrid ac milan ... the list goes on a very long way. once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you. sometimes it is promotion or a place in europe sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle. it might even be a case of champions or else. obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose so choose wisely. then it is time to look at your squad work out your tactics seeing how much cash if any you have got to splash having a look at the transfer market sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it. then bring on the matches which are once more available in the ever-improving top down view. with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface not much else seems to have changed. however there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well - things like the manager mind-games which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses. the match engine is also much improved and it is more of a joy than ever to watch. in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked and it leads to an ever more immersive experience. with a game that is so complex and so open-ended there are of course a few glitches but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases. with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches though there have been improvements in this area. and a sport like football which is so high profile and unpredictable itself can never be modelled quite to everybody s satisfaction. but this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only and do not affect gameplay. and if there are problems further down the line sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible. in all there are many more tweaks and improvements. if you were a fan of the previous cm games then might make you forget there was anything else before it. if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership spurs into europe or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree could be the best purchase you ever made. just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas. football manager out now for the pc and the mac
1191,jones files lawsuit against conte marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs. the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $ (£) in the suit. conte whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday conte said: i stand by everything i said . jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in . her lawsuit filed in the us district court in san francisco said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs . conte s statements the suit added were false and malicious . after the abc television program earlier this month jones lawyer richard nicholls said: marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never ever used performance-enhancing drugs. victor conte is a man facing a -count federal indictment while marion jones is one of america s most decorated female athletes. mr conte s statements have been wildly contradictory. mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination. mr conte is simply not credible. we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed. the sport s ruling body the iaaf is taking a cautious approach to conte s allegations but contacted the us anti-doping agency. communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte for further information . but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. if it is felt there is case to answer it would be for its national governing body (usa track and field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action he added. the us anti-doping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. and i am sure like ourselves they will be watching the television programme with great interest. jones who is under investigation for steroid use by the us anti-doping agency has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed. jones who did not win any medals in athens in august has never failed a drugs test. meanwhile conte who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering is due to face trial in march.
1473,bmw to recall faulty diesel cars bmw is to recall all cars equipped with a faulty diesel fuel-injection pump supplied by parts maker robert bosch. the faulty part does not represent a safety risk and the recall only affects pumps made in december and january. bmw said that it was too early to say how many cars were affected or how much the recall would cost. the german company is to extend a planned production break at one of its plants due to the faulty bosch part. the dingolfing site will now be closed all next week instead of for just two days. the additional three-day stoppage will mean a production loss of up to vehicles bmw said adding that it was confident it could make up the numbers later. bosch has stopped production of the part but expects to restart by february. the faulty component does not represent a safety risk but causes the motor to stall after a significant amount of mileage. when asked if bmw would be seeking compensation from bosch the carmaker s chief executive helmut panke said: we will first solve the problem before talking about who will pay . audi and mercedes benz were also supplied with the defective diesel fuel-injection pumps but neither of them have to recall any vehicles. a spokesman for daimlerchrysler parent company of mercedes benz said it will however have to halt some production. it is to close the mercedes factory in sindelfingen on monday and tuesday. audi said it had been hit by production bottlenecks due to a shortage of unaffected bosch parts.
1981,minister hits out at yukos sale russia s renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed a senior government figure has warned. economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was unjustified . his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm s assets into public ownership. on december another senior economic adviser called the sale the swindle of the century . yuganskneftegaz the unit which produced % of yukos output had been seized and sold in december for less than $ to a previously unknown firm called baikal. baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm rosneft itself shortly to merge with state gas giant gazprom. we used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing andrei illarionov - then economic adviser to president vladimir putin - told a press conference. now officials are doing it. within days he was stripped of most of his responsibilities. mr gref a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronov s comments. the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the had been badly handled he said. but he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil. i think that rosneft and yuganskneftegaz should it become a state-owned company must be privatized he said. today our government is ineffective and state companies as a result are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well. and he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like yukos - a technique now being applied by the kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. if we follow that logic we should nationalise all businesses he said. many large russian companies particularly in the energy sector use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes. mr gref also poured cold water on president putin s promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. the assault on yukos assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months. the task is not simply to double gdp; instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve people s lives mr gref told kommersant. we don t need simply to increase gdp but to improve its structure. instead of focusing on headline growth figures russia needed to focus on better institutions such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.
1537,classy henman makes winning start tim henman opened his campaign with a - - victory over argentine david nalbandian at the kooyong classic exhibition tournament on wednesday. the british number one will next play roger federer at the australian open warm-up event on friday. the world number one beat gaston gaudio - - - before andre agassi saw off chilean olympic gold medalist nicolas massu - - (-). andy roddick beat ivan ljubicic who replaced paradorn srichaphan - -. henman made an impressive start to the year only faltering against nalbandian when serving for the match at -. but the briton regained his composure to win the next two games for only his second win in six matches against the argentine. it s a great start to the year - just what i was looking for henman told his website. over the years i ve found david very difficult to play against. he returns serve very well and he s deceptively effective from the baseline so sometimes it can be difficult to execute my gameplan well enough against him to get the right result. beating somebody of his stature is always good for the confidence and it bodes well at the beginning of the year. henman also revealed the extent of the back problems he suffered in the off-season. i m not the most flexible and at the end of the year i was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where i didn t do anything said henman. when i started training again it really really seized up. as much as i enjoyed the two weeks off i don t think it s so productive. federer dropped a tight first set against french open champion gaudio but was content with his game. it was about getting used to the surface he said. the conditions are much quicker than doha my timing was ok but i could have served better. all in all i m happy with the match and i won it - that s a good sign. now i have a day off and hopefully play better the next match. agassi was delighted with victory over massu in his first match for over two months. i felt pretty good said the american. i liked the way the match played out and maybe excluding a few second serve returns i felt like i was doing most things pretty darn well for the first match.
1033,labour s eu propaganda a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise on the eu is being used to lull the british public into a false sense of security say the tories. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution. his claims were denied by foreign secretary jack straw who accused the tories of running scared of debate. eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls he argued. mr straw used thursday s commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in . security stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july said mr straw. africa and climate change would also feature highly. he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to % of europe s economic output and were spent where it adds most value . mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uk s budget rebate secured in by margaret thatcher was fully justified . we like all other countries have a veto on any changes proposed in this area he said. mr ancram condemned the document which the foreign office says has cost about £ to design print and deliver. isn t the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new eu to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election he asked. the tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the eu constitution would make europe easier to understand. the government last week had to publish a commentary of pages to try and explain this easy and simple constitution to the british people he said. who are they trying to kid the proposed question for the constitution referendum is: should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. the government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring with the tories set to campaign for a no vote. mr ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. the foreign secretary hit back by saying tory attitudes to europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a level playing field on immigration and asylum controls. you are setting your face against all of these things he added. for the liberal democrats sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy. change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets he argued. sir menzies was among those worried about plans backed by the uk to lift the arms embargo imposed on china after the tiananmen square massacre. mr straw said no decisions had been taken - chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.
2128,house prices suffer festive fall uk house prices fell .% in december according to figures from the office of the deputy prime minister. nationally house prices rose at an annual rate of .% in december less than the .% rise the previous month. the average uk house price fell from £ in november to £ reflecting recent land registry figures confirming a slowdown in late . all major uk regions apart from northern ireland experienced a fall in annual growth during december. december is traditionally a quiet month for the housing market because of christmas celebrations. however recent figures from the land registry - showing a big drop in sales between the last quarter of and the previous year - suggested the slowdown could be more than a seasonal blip. the volume of sales between october and december dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in the land registry said. although both the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) and the land registry figures point to a slowdown in the market the most recent surveys from nationwide and halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. after registering falls at the back-end of halifax said house prices rose by .% in january and nationwide reported a rise of .% in the first month of the year.
250,wenger handed summer war chest arsenal boss arsene wenger has been guaranteed transfer funds to boost his squad the summer. the club s managing director keith edelman stressed that the development of their new £ stadium had no affect on wenger s spending power. the money is there. don t worry we ve got it edelman told bbc sport. hopefully we ll spend it this summer and in the coming years. arsene attends all our board meetings and he knows our finances are very strong. edelman added that it was pointless having a brand new stadium if the team did not match the surroundings. its great to have nice new surroundings but if the team aren t performing on the pitch then there isn t great respect in having a fabulous stadium he said. it s important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place before we began on the stadium.
2166,us to raise tv indecency fines us politicians are proposing a tough new law aimed at cracking down on indecency and bad language on us tv. fines of up to $ (£ ) could be imposed each time broadcasters transmit nudity or profanities. the proposal unveiled in the house of representatives also seeks to revoke a broadcaster s licence after three violations have been committed. the exposure of janet jackson s breast at last year s superbowl landed cbs with a $ (£ ) fine. entertainers could also be liable for fines under the proposed legisation from both us politcians and officials from the federal communications commission (fcc). a republican senator from kansas sam brownbeck is set to call for a maximum $ million (£. million) fine for repeated violations. the current maximum fine stands at $ (£ ) - of the stations in the cbs network were each penalised these lesser amounts for the jackson incident. republican politician fred upton who chairs the committee responsible for broadcasting said current fines are more of a cost of doing business rather than a deterrent . last year s janet jackson wardrobe malfunction encouraged the fcc to impose tougher rules but the us congress adjourned last year without agreeing on a new level of fines. new figures have to be decided before new legislation can be put before president bush. certain broadcasters like fox claim the material they carry does not violate indecency laws and is protected under the right to free speech.
123,screensaver tackles spam websites net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites internet portal lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail. lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out. the net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data. we ve never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do said malte pollmann spokesman for lycos europe. in the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users he said but now we are going to go one step further. we ve found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers. by getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity. mr pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with. he said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web. every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day he said about one file. but he said if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day. lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back said mr pollmann. that would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing he said. the sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer. typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e-mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day. the list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as spamcop. to limit the chance of mistakes being made lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods. as these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive said mr pollmann. sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests. early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to %. users do not have to be registered users of lycos to download and use the screensaver. while working the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data. the screensaver is due to be launched across europe on december and before now has only been trialled in sweden. despite the soft launch mr pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than times in the last four days. there s a huge user demand to not only filter spam day-by-day but to do something more he said before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive.
1993,parmalat bank barred from suing bank of america has been banned from suing parmalat the food group which went bust in after an accounting scandal. the bank - along with investors auditors and the group s managers - wants damages for being a victim of fraud at the hands of the italian firm. but a judge has barred bank of america and two auditors from the case. the bank and italaudit - formerly the italian arm of auditor grant thornton - face lawsuits and possible prosecution. a second auditor deloitte & touche has also been banned from the case. grant thornton - now rid of the italian unit at the centre of the case - is still being permitted to sue as are consob italy s stock market regulator hundreds of small investors and parmalat s new managers. parmalat collapsed in december after it emerged that the euros ($.; £.) it supposedly held in a bank of american offshore account did not in fact exist.
0,tv future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems plasma high-definition tvs and digital video recorders moving into the living room the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years time. that is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. with the us leading the trend programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks through cable satellite telecoms companies and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices. one of the most talked-about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders (dvr and pvr). these set-top boxes like the us s tivo and the uk s sky+ system allow people to record store play pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want. essentially the technology allows for much more personalised tv. they are also being built-in to high-definition tv sets which are big business in japan and the us but slower to take off in europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. not only can people forward wind through adverts they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as brand identity and viewer loyalty to channels. although the us leads in this technology at the moment it is also a concern that is being raised in europe particularly with the growing uptake of services like sky+. what happens here today we will see in nine months to a years time in the uk adam hume the bbc broadcast s futurologist told the bbc news website. for the likes of the bbc there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. it is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters but brand loyalty is important for everyone. we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands said tim hanlon from brand communications firm starcom mediavest. the reality is that with broadband connections anybody can be the producer of content. he added: the challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice. what this means said stacey jolna senior vice president of tv guide tv group is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers. it means that networks in us terms or channels could take a leaf out of google s book and be the search engine of the future instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. but it might not suit everyone the panel recognised. older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands mr hanlon suggested. on the other end you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them said mr hanlon. ultimately the consumer will tell the market they want. of the new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces many of them are about enhancing the tv-watching experience. high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them instead of being external boxes. one such example launched at the show is humax s -inch lcd tv with an -hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder. one of the us s biggest satellite tv companies directtv has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with -hours of recording capability instant replay and a search function. the set can pause and rewind tv for up to hours. and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with tivo called tivotogo which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices. all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want when they want.
918,intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light. scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade. we ve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel s photonics technology lab. writing in the journal nature dr paniccia - and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it. telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved. we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia. while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said. but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy-to-make filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. it s a technical validation that it can work he said.
1395,dawson joins england injury list scrum-half matt dawson is an injury doubt for england s six nations opener against wales next weekend. the world cup winner missed wasps - loss to bath on saturday after injuring his right calf. wasps coach warren gatland said: he s got a fitness test in the week but he s got a good chance of playing. gloucester s andy hazell and leicester star lewis moody also received knocks during their respective league matches but should be fit for wales next week. if dawson is not fit to face wales robinson will have to choose from gloucester s andy gomarsall or leicester youngster harry ellis. jamie noon is another player on the sidelines after he limped off in the first half against saracens on friday with a dead leg. the centre who is in line for a first six nations start against wales will have to wait hours before knowing the state of his injury.
1924,straw to attend auschwitz service foreign secretary jack straw will visit auschwitz for the anniversary of the former nazi concentration camp s liberation it has been announced. prince edward will also join the uk delegation in poland for national holocaust memorial day on january. between . and . million people mainly jews were killed at auschwitz. the tories said they were glad mr straw had been shamed into going having earlier criticised the decision to send a lower-ranking official. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said: i am glad the foreign secretary has finally been shamed into representing britain at this important act of commemoration. once again this government has shown crass insensitivity until it has been forced by public opinion into doing what it should have done in the first place. in britain the queen and prince philip will lead the nation s commemoration at a service in westminster hall london. the queen will also host a reception for holocaust survivors at st james s palace. altogether some six million people mainly jews perished in the holocaust. the queen s grandson prince harry sparked outrage earlier this week after photographs of him wearing a nazi uniform at a costume party emerged. the prince apologised but critics have called for him to go to auschwitz for the commemoration of the soviets liberation of the camp. prince harry should see for himself the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear rabbi marvin hier founder of jewish human rights group the simon wiesenthal center said.
1393,viewers to be able to shape tv imagine editing titanic down to watch just your favourite bits or cutting out the slushier moments of star wars to leave you with a bare bones action-fest. manipulating your favourite films to make a more personalised movie is just the beginning of an ambitious new . euro (£.) project funded by the european union. new media for a new millennium () will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes. viewers will be able to participate in storylines manipulate plots and even the sets and props of tv shows. bt is one of partners involved in the project. it will be contributing software that was originally designed to spot anomalies in cctv pictures. the software uses content recognition algorithms. the three-year project will work on seven productions as it develops a set of software tools that will allow viewers to edit content to their needs. one of the productions will be a experimental television show where the plot will be driven by text messages from the tv audience. participants will text selected words which will impact how the characters in the drama interact. it is being developed in finland and will be shown to finnish tv audiences. another team will work on the bbc s big budget drama of mervyn peake s gothic fantasy gormenghast. it will be re-engineered to allow people to choose a variety of edited versions. the bbc is allowing us access to the material so that we can prove the technology and the principles explained dr doug williams of bt who will be s technical project manager. the tv at the moment is a relatively dumb box which receives signals. this project is about teaching the machine to look at content like lego blocks that can be reassembled to make perfect sense he said. at the moment we have interactive gaming and a limited form of interactive tv which usually means allowing audiences to vote on shows. we are hoping to occupy the space in-between he added. s co-ordinator peter stollenmayer explained that the new genre would radically alter the role of the audience. viewers will be able to interact directly with the medium and influence what they see and hear according to their personal tastes and wishes he said. media users will no longer be passive viewers but become active engagers. it will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said john wyver from tv producer illuminations television limited which is also involved in the project. it s not just a matter of stringing together the romantic or action portions of a production said mr wyver. the tool has to know which bits fit together both visually by observing the time-honoured rules that go in editing and in terms of the story. only then will the personalised version both make sense and be aesthetically pleasing he added. mr wyver is planning a production entitled the golden age about renaissance art. it will allow viewers to create a so-called media world based on their own specific areas of interest such as poetry music and architecture. other productions that the team will make range from news documentaries to a romantic comedy drama.
1851,observers to monitor uk election ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming uk general election is fairly run. the move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. a report by two mps committees called on thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. but in a written response to labour mp gordon prentice the government said it would normally invite observers to any uk election. junior constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said: i fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced. the government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout which fell to % in the last general election in . but trial all-postal ballots in four english regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. liberal democrat peer lord greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges on a scale not seen since the century . thursday s report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) and the department for constitutional affairs (dca). it said that with the growth of postal voting there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually rather than by household. it also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so. figures for the general election suggest % of people aged between and and % of black voters were not on the electoral roll. young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. odpm committee chairman andrew bennett said individual voter registration as opposed to registration by household should be quickly introduced as it could dramatically reduce the chances of fraud . but his counterpart on the dca committee alan beith said it should be delayed until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective. shadow constitutional affairs secretary oliver heald accused the government of dragging its feet over this badly needed measure . it is vital that we move ahead with the northern ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the britain s electoral system he said. the report said individual registration should be treated carefully as % of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in northern ireland when it was introduced in . the report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. it said incentives to register such as £ council tax rebate were likely to be seen as gimmicks and risked undermining the integrity of the system mps said. instead they called for imaginative campaigns to boost interest.

2103,ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. market leader nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played. the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks. far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a handheld prototype. the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen. the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm s pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market. nintendo first launched its gameboy console in and has dominated the market ever since. but its lead can no longer be taken for granted. sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable while start-up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices. we believe the ds will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill said david yarnton nintendo europe s general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. with its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points. it went on sale in the us in mid-november priced $ and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures. japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of to get the device. with more than two million pre-orders for the device in japan nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters - a action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine s wireless capabilities. it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people. the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. super mario ds is a faithful re-creation of the nintendo classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. one thing is for certain. hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds s key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.

1900,mcilroy aiming for madrid title northern ireland man james mcilroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend s spar european indoor championships in madrid. the -year-old has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the metres favourites. i believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in sheffield i can run my race from the front back or middle said mcilroy. new coach tony lester has helped get mcilroy s career back on track. the -year-old metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards. mcilroy now lives in windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the no-nonsense leadership style of former army sergeant lester. lester is better known for his work with runners roger black and mark richardson in the past but under his guidance mcilroy has secured five wins this indoor season. mcilroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for ireland at the outdoor european championships in . that was my last decent year said mcilroy who temporarily retired last august before returning to the sport under lester s shrewd guidance. before every race was like trying to climb mount everest and i now know you can t do it on your own. trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing half-dead and terrified on the starting line which became a bit too much. mcilroy who was compared to the likes of sebastian coe steve cram and steve ovett in his younger days is now competing without the benefit of national lottery funding. that situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the world-class times he produced in the and at major races in erfurt and stuttgart earlier this season. russian dmitriy bogdanov won at the same madrid venue last week and then claimed the european championship race would be between himself dutchman arnoud okken and antonio reina of spain but mcilroy is unfazed. he admitted: he looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion. i never write myself off and let s face it i haven t or looked like being beaten this season. and mcilroy whose time of one minute . in erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the uk all-time list is also already looking beyond madrid. he said: i ve been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important. ultimately of course this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summer s world championships. that ambition has meant that i ve had only two nights out since last august. the rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career.
1286,protesters plan airport challenge campaigners against the expansion of britain s airports have begun challenging the government s plans in the high court. baa s expansion of stansted airport in essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. opponents say the £ cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from heathrow and gatwick was used. they said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. baa are also owners of the airports at heathrow and gatwick. they have said they cannot raise the money needed for the stansted upgrades from current landing charges. baa also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at luton airport or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at heathrow. if the group wins the government s future aviation plans outlined in last year s transport white paper could be left in ruins. the campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports such as one planned for the isle of sheppey east of london. lord hanningfield leader of essex county council told bbc radio s today programme: we are going to the high court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. we want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation consultation and thought before the government came out with its green paper. then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go. he added: politicians should not decide where runways should be. the stansted expansion apart from the building of the new runway would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected passengers who will use it every year. the airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the uk. but baa has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. at heathrow gatwick edinburgh and glasgow airports baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september which will close next week. baa is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked unblighted price. at heathrow baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. at gatwick the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.

1761,campese berates whingeing england former australian wing david campese has told england to stop whingeing in the wake of their defeat to ireland. england coach andy robinson lambasted referee jonathan kaplan for costing them the game after disallowing tries from mark cueto and josh lewsey. but campese told bbc sport: robinson is living up to england s reputation as whingeing poms. stop going on about it as who really cares they re acting like they re the first team to be cheated of a win. england are contemplating a complaint to the international rugby board after potential tries by cueto in the first half and lewsey late on were ruled out without recourse to the video referee. but campese added: scotland could have beaten france in the same way but do you see them whingeing basically things didn t go england s way and in typical fashion they make more of it when they believe they ve lost unfairly. england are second bottom in the six nations table following defeats by wales france and ireland. but although campese admitted he was surprised about their current predicament he insisted england were no longer world class . england are beginning to realise that being world champions doesn t mean you deserve to win every game he said. they lost a few key players and suddenly everyone s realised the ones on the fringes were not all that good in the first place. added to that the senior players aren t standing up and they can t do anything when the pressure mounts. campese a veteran of international caps said full-back jason robinson would now be the sole englishman in his world xv. robinson has been blamed for poor leadership in the tournament while his coach has been castigated for appointing a full-back captain. i agree that you can t captain from full-back said campese. you need someone in the thick of the action and it s very hard to give orders from all the way back there. some people are leaders and some aren t. he s not but there s no one who stands out in england s pack - no clear-cut leaders. campese though defended coach andy robinson who he believes was the only choice after sir clive woodward s resignation. but he blamed a lack of talent in the england camp for making the current coach look poor. england face a potential wooden spoon match against italy on march. and the ex-wallaby added: if england lost that they d be in bloody turmoil. that said i don t think they will. campese has tipped wales to win both the six nations and grand slam come the end of the tournament. it s been a surprising tournament he said and maybe ireland have a little bit more talent overall. but playing at home is a major boost. and the possible grand slam decider at the millennium stadium will be just too much for the irish.

1682,blair rejects iraq advice calls tony blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation. the prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the attorney general. earlier conservative mp michael mates joined calls for a probe into claims lord goldsmith s statement to parliament was drawn up at number . mr blair said the statement was a fair summary of lord goldsmith s opinion. that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue saying it had been dealt with literally scores of times and the position has not changed . lord goldsmith has denied being leaned on and says the words written were his. the government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. mr mates who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence told the bbc on friday: that as a general rule is right but it s not an absolute rule. he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention he said. mr mates added: we discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers advice to the government has been published. and this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister. this is argument was rejected by mr blair who said: firstly we haven t broken the precedent and secondly peter goldsmith has made his statement and i have got absolutely nothing to add to it. in a book published this week philippe sands qc a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on march that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action. but a short statement about lord goldsmith s position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on march - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. mr sands book suggests it was actually written by home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan. former minister clare short who resigned from the government over the iraq war said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she told the bbc the full advice should have been attached according to the ministerial code. my view is we need the house of lords to set up a special committee summon the attorney get all the papers out look at exactly what happened she said. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. on thursday lord goldsmith said his statement had not been written by or at number . in my parliamentary answer on march i explained my genuinely held independent view that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions he said.

1640,blog picked as word of the year the term blog has been chosen as the top word of by a us dictionary publisher. merriam-webster said blog headed the list of most looked-up terms on its site during the last twelve months. during blogs or web logs have become hugely popular and some have started to influence mainstream media. other words on the merriam-webster list were associated with major news events such as the us presidential election or natural disasters that hit the us. merriam-webster defines a blog as: a web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections comments and often hyperlinks . its list of most looked-up words is drawn up every year and it discounts terms such as swear words that everyone likes to look up or those that always cause problems such as affect and effect . merriam-webster said blog was the word that people have asked to be defined or explained most often over the last months. the word will now appear in the version of merriam-webster s printed dictionary. however the word is already included in some printed versions of the oxford english dictionary. a spokesman for the oxford university press said that the word was now being put into other dictionaries for children and learners reflecting its mainstream use. i think it was the word of last year rather than this year he said. now we re getting words that derive from it such as blogosphere and so on he said. but he added it s a pretty recent thing and in the way that this happens these days it s got established very quickly. blogs come in many different forms. many act as news sites for particular groups or subjects some are written from a particular political slant and others are simply lists of interesting sites. other terms in the top were related to natural disasters that have struck the us such as hurricane or were to do with the us election. words such as incumbent electoral and partisan reflected the scale of interest in the vote. blogs also proved very useful to both sides in the us election battle because many pundits who maintain their own journals were able to air opinions that would never appear in more mainstream media. speculation that president bush was getting help during debates via a listening device was first aired on web logs. online journals also raised doubts about documents used by us television news organisation cbs in a story about president bush s war record. the immediacy of many blogs also helped some wield influence over topics that made it in to national press. this is despite the fact that the number of people reading even the most influential blogs is tiny. statistics by web influence ranking firm hitwise reveal that the most popular political blog racks up only .% of all net visits per day. one of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online. according to blog analysis firm technorati the number of blogs in existence the blogosphere has doubled every five and a half months for the last months. technorati now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded . million. some speculate that less than a quarter of this number are regularly maintained. according to us research firm pew internet & american life a blog is created every . seconds. another trend this year has been the increasing numbers of weblogs that detail the daily lives of many ordinary workers in jobs that few people know much about. in many repressive regimes and developing nations blogs have been embraced by millions of people keen to give their plight a voice.

40,labour targets hardcore truants a fresh crackdown on persistent truants in england has been launched by education secretary ruth kelly. serial truants make up one in pupils. previous initiatives brought pupils back to school since according to official statistics. parenting contracts penalty notices and fast track prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem. it is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day. tories say labour s previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence where parents are permitted to take children out of school. such absences are often due to family holidays. however serial truants avoid the classroom despite government schemes costing £. those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically. measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term. in one local education authority alone parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child s attendance improved. the tough stance paid off with just issued while attendance improved in cases. truancy has been reduced by % at the worst hit schools through the government s behaviour improvement programme. this is the equivalent of pupils back in classes since september. the new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps - the sixth of which will take place on monday. police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school. held twice each year in addition to routine local patrols previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended pupils dodging school. in almost of those cases the youngsters were accompanied by their parents. a department for education and skills source said: every day in school counts. it is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation s truancy.
1968,brussels raps mobile call charges the european commission has written to the mobile phone operators vodafone and t-mobile to challenge the high rates they charge for international roaming. in letters sent to the two companies the commission alleged the firms were abusing their dominant market position in the german mobile phone market. it is the second time vodafone has come under the commission s scrutiny. the uk operator is already appealing against allegations that its uk roaming rates are unfair and excessive . vodafone s response to the commission s letter was defiant. we believe the roaming market is competitive and we expect to resist the charges said a vodafone spokesman. however we will need time to examine the statement of objections in detail before we formally respond. the commission s investigation into vodafone and deutsche telekom s t-mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in germany. the commission believes these wholesale prices are too high and that the excess is passed on to consumers. the commission aims to ensure that european consumers are not overcharged when they use their mobile phones on their travels around the european union the commission said in a statement. vodafone and britain s other big mobile phone operator were sent similar statements of objections by the commission in july last year. vodafone sent the commission a response to those allegations in december last year and is now waiting for a reply. the vodafone spokesman said a similar process would be set in motion with these latest statement of objections about its operations in germany. the companies will have three months to respond to the commission s allegations and the process may go on for some time yet the spokesman said. the commission could charge the companies up to % of their annual turnover though in practice that sort of figure is rarely demanded. the commission s latest move comes just a few months after national telecoms regulators across europe launched a joint investigation which could lead to people being charged less for using their mobile phone when travelling abroad. the investigation involves regulators assessing whether there is effective competition in the roaming market.
1937,howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards. the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a collective view after holding a good discussion but admitted it was not an easy issue . he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday. tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo his transport and environment spokesman said the plans stink . he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would set out the position very clearly when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives . he added: when the police say that you have to take them seriously . he acknowledged there were good libertarian arguments against the cards but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the conflicting interests before reaching its decision. i don t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken. he also denied he was afraid of looking soft on the issue compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening. sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme. they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected. it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and deeply flawed . he said: this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues concerns over id cards. the chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists. what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained. tory ex-minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a regressive step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.

1609,a year to remember for irish there used to be one subliminal moment during a year in irish rugby that stood out more than most. well at least there used to one. now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction and sorrow. it has been quite a year for the irish and not just with eddie o sullivan s triple crown winning international outfit either. right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. but most of the kudos will go to o sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for years but also finished their autumn campaign with a % record. for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the rbs six nations. but in the three games in november which included a victory over tri-nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa ireland finsihed the year on a high. the - victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in . that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer. those two reverses and the - flop against france were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent months. but the big one of course was the - defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf. the winning try was conceived in o sullivan s mind perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey. for me the try of the championship. o sullivan s career is now in vertical take-off mode. it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galway-based coach to head the lions test side. not only that but a fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand. there can be no doubt that ireland s representation will be the biggest ever albeit in a proposed -man squad. in brian o driscoll and paul o connell ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. gordon d arcy whose career began as a teenager back in finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament. but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. the under- squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider. the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to england in the six nations under- tournament. on the provincial front leinster for second year in succession blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager. while ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession it was munster again flying the flag for the irish. looking to reach their third final they went down - to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road. how wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybody s guess. ulster meanwhile just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game. ulster however took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall. the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first outings in the celtic league. leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing. on the down side irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under- world cup game in durban. that happened only days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools cup success since . the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known londonderry ym player jim huey coleraine s jonathan hutchinson and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole. they all passed away long before the full-time whistle.
1352,india and russia in energy talks india and russia are to work together in a series of energy deals part of a pact which could see india invest up to $ in oil and gas projects. on the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals to be led by russian energy giant gazprom and india s ongc. the indian firm is also expected to hold talks on tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by yukos. it is reported to be keen on buying a % stake in oil unit yuganskneftegas. the former yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant rosneft. russian media reported that india and russia signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation on tuesday during a meeting between oil and natural gas corporation chairman subir raha gazprom chairman aleksey miller and india s petroleum minister mani shankar aiyar. the agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in russia india and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil gas and petrochemicals from russia to india and other countries across asia. ongc could invest in gas and oil fields in sakhalin in the far east of russia and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern siberia and the caspian sea. india is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than % a year. ongc s mr raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next year. at current oil and gas prices our cash flow situation is good he told reuters. what we are saying is - gazprom has a huge amount of gas and we have the money. the investment may go up to $ or more for a period of five years or so. russian news agencies reported that india s petroleum minister mr aiyar and russian energy minister viktor khristenko would discuss the future of yugansk at a meeting on tuesday. ongc s mr raha declined to be drawn on his firm s reported interest in the company. however he stressed that ongc was not interested in a loan-for-oil deal in connection to yugansk similar to that concluded recently between rosneft and china s national petroleum corporation. china s problem is it has immediate demand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries. we do not. we would like long-term security through equity participation. it is thought that any decision over yugansk will be delayed until a us court has decided whether to grant yukos bankruptcy protection. yukos is suing a host of companies involved in the sale of yugansk auctioned off to pay a huge back-tax bill. it has also threatened legal action against any business which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary.

1411,net fingerprints combat attacks eighty large net service firms have switched on software to spot and stop net attacks automatically. the system creates digital fingerprints of ongoing incidents that are sent to every network affected. firms involved in the smart sensing system believe it will help trace attacks back to their source. data gathered will be passed to police to help build up intelligence about who is behind worm outbreaks and denial of service attacks. firms signing up for the sensing system include mci bt deutsche telekom energis ntt bell canada and many others. the creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by us firm arbor networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack. increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites launch worms and relay spam around the net. we have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic said rob pollard sales director for arbor networks which is behind the fingerprinting system. attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination he said. once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem. mr pollard said arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected. what we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source said mr pollard. arbor network s technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network. it spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups. any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a net-based attack of some kind. this type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines. anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack. attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated said malcolm seagrave security expert at energis. in the last months it started getting noticeable that criminals were taking to it and we ve seen massive growth. he said that although informal systems exist to pass on information about attacks often commercial confidentiality got in the way of sharing enough information to properly combat attacks.
1650,brown s poll campaign move denied the government has denied reports that gordon brown is preparing to oust alan milburn as labour s election supremo. work and pensions minister alan johnson said it was wrong to suggest the chancellor would usurp mr milburn adding they would work as a team . a report in the sunday business claimed mr brown has been asked to take charge of media strategy while mr milburn would move to a behind-the-scenes role. labour has always maintained mr brown would have a central campaign role. but many labour backbenchers are said to be dissatisfied with the way election campaigning has gone and have said they wanted to see the chancellor take a bigger role. some commentators say the tories have grasped the initiative putting labour on the back foot having to respond to conservative policy announcements. these claims follow various opinion polls which suggest the tories have been gaining on labour. party strategists are believed to want to bring mr brown to centre-stage having seen support rise in private polling after his budget last week. but another report in the sunday telegraph claims mr milburn is unwilling to allow any new role for the chancellor to come at his expense. mr johnson told bbc news: gordon brown will play a central role in any election campaign. they were wrong when they said milburn was ousting brown and they re wrong now if they are saying brown is ousting milburn. we work as a team. mr milburn has repeatedly said the chancellor was key to the campaign and dismissed claims of a rift. neither downing street nor the labour party would comment directly on the reports.

1922,eu to probe alitalia state aid the european commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether italian airline alitalia is receiving illegal state aid. commission officials are to look at rome s provision of a euro ($; £) loan to the carrier. both the italian government and alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. the investigation could take up to months. however transport commissioner jacques barrot said he wanted it to be carried out as swiftly as possible. the italian authorities have presented a serious industrial plan said mr barot. we now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid. i would like our analysis to be completed swiftly. the matter of possible state aid was brought to the commission s attention by eight of alitalia s rivals including germany s lufthansa british airways and spain s iberia. while alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. alitalia lost euros in as it struggled to get to grips with high costs spiralling oil prices competition from budget carriers and reduced demand. it plans to split into az fly and az services which will handle air and ground services respectively. alitalia already enjoyed state aid in . eu rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the one time last time rule for airlines. otherwise eu regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially but only on the same terms as a commercial investor. the airline declined to comment on the commission decision.
1266,blunkett row should end - blair prime minister tony blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding david blunkett. the tories and the lib dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast-tracking of a visa application for mr blunkett s ex-lover s nanny. sir alan budd found a chain of events linked mr blunkett to leoncia casalme s indefinite leave to remain application. at the end of his middle east trip mr blair said he still admired mr blunkett and thought his integrity was intact. on tuesday sir alan said the application for leave to remain in the uk made by kimberly quinn s nanny was processed in days days faster than the average. but he could not find evidence to show whether mr blunkett s intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover s nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance. in his first comments since sir alan s announcement mr blair told bbc news he had not yet read the report in detail. but told bbc news: as far as i m concerned we have drawn a line under that. asked if mr blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point he replied: i have made my admiration for david very clear and it remains. he s been a tremendous colleague he s done a great job for us first as home secretary then as education secretary. the future is something we will have to approach in the future. the prime minister shrugged off claims from conservative leader michael howard that he led a grubby government . he said mr blunkett s integrity remained intact: he was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up. he accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened he said. but i think sir alan budd also accepted there wasn t some conspiracy or cover-up and i just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on. earlier mr howard said: there does need to be another inquiry a judge-led inquiry. there were so many questions that weren t answered. there was deceit at the heart of government which was not limited to the visa affair he argued. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten also said there was a strong case for a judge-led judicial review . he said: next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. it may be about something even more important than that. mr blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of sir alan s findings. in a statement the ex-home secretary said he accepted the inquiry s findings. he said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system.
205,alfa romeos to get gm engines fiat is to stop making six-cylinder petrol engines for its sporty alfa romeo subsidiary unions at the italian carmaker have said. the unions claim fiat is to close the fiat powertrain plant at arese near milan and instead source six-cylinder engines from general motors. fiat has yet to comment on the matter but the unions say the new engines will be made by gm in australia. the news comes a week after gm pulled out of an agreement to buy fiat. gm had to pay former partner fiat . euros ($; £.) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the italian carmaker outright. fiat and gm also ended their five-year alliance and two joint ventures in engines and purchasing but did agree to continue buying each other s engines. powertrain told us today that alfa romeo engines will no longer be made in arese said union leader vincenzo lilliu as reported by the reuters news agency. the assembly line will be dismantled and the six-cylinder alfa romeo motor will be replaced with an engine gm produces in australia. reuters also said that mr lilliu and other union bosses shouted insults at fiat chairman luca di montezemolo following a meeting on tuesday regarding the future of the arese plant. the unions said the end of engine production at the facility would mean the loss of jobs. all alfa romeo models can be bought with a six-cylinder engine - the sportwagon gtv gt and spider.
1415,row brewing over peer-to-peer ads music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience. the debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser s dream come true and a branding nightmare. paul myers chief executive of wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing oxygen for companies that support illegal downloading. you may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service edonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include nat west vodafone first direct ntl and renault he said in an open letter to the british phonographic industry last month. he urged people to follow his lead and dump brands associated with companies such as edonkey. the bpi is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. networks like edonkey kazaa and grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. the bpi strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue it said in a statement. illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. we are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses it said. but the issue is often more complicated for advertisers said mark mulligan a music analyst with jupiter research. this has been a problem for a long time ever since the days of napster he told the bbc news website. the reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience he said. if you put the legality issues aside not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience he added. meanwhile companies contacted by the bbc news website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. onetel adverts were spotted on edonkey this week and its response was typical. we have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. it is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks read a statement from the discount phone firm. it has requested the advert be removed immediately said a spokeswoman. similarly telecommunications firm ntl blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. since the matter was brought to its attention last month the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites a spokesman told the bbc news website. however mr mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. while smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends this is no excuse for well-known brands he said. i would be surprised if these brands didn t have the know-how to prevent this happening he said. at the moment edonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. many big brands have leveraged the opportunity including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - senator john kerry and president george w. bush said chief executive sam yagan. there are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network he thinks. peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they re most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media he said.
2116,a decade of good website design the web looks very different today than it did years ago. back in yahoo had only just launched most websites were text-based and amazon google and ebay had yet to appear. but says usability guru dr jakob nielsen some things have stayed constant in that decade namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use. dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today. roughly % of the things we found years ago are still an issue today he said. some have gone away because users have changed and % have changed because technology has changed. some design crimes such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared said dr nielsen. but there s great stability on usability concerns he told the bbc news website. dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site s total design were as important as ever. it s necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such he said. they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would. a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off he said. but there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband. dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google amazon ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important. those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful said dr nielsen adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net. all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet he said. they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user. none of them have a fancy or glamorous look he added declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied. in the future dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online. they are becoming like the operating system to the internet he said. but he said the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better. currently he said search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries. often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not. tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results. research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines. the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that on average they use . terms. in only . words were used. i think it s amazing that we have seen a doubling in a -year period of those search terms said dr nielsen. you can hear more from jakob nielsen and web design on the bbc world service programme go digital

209,aragones angered by racism fine spain coach luis aragones is furious after being fined by the spanish football federation for his comments about thierry henry. the -year-old criticised his euros (£ ) punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty. i am not guilty nor do i accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport he said. i m not a racist and i ve never lacked sporting decorum. i ve never done that and i have medals for sporting merit. aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal team-mate and spanish international jose reyes last october. the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones but was then requested to do so by spain s anti-violence commission. the fine was far less than the expected amount of about £ or even the suspension of his coaching licence. arsenal boss arsene wenger who was fined £ in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating believes that aragones punishment was too lenient. you compare his fine and my fine and if you consider his was for racist abuse then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should wenger said. he shouldn t have said what he said and how much money is enough i don t know but it doesn t look a big punishment. however aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair. i have been treated like islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter manolete) said aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions. i have not liked one thing about this whole affair and i do not agree with the sanction. they have looked for a scapegoat. spain s anti-violence commission must now ratify the spanish fa s decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. aragones has days to appeal and the commission can also appeal. alberto flores president of the spanish fa s disciplinary committee said no-one in the committee felt aragones was a racist nor had acted in a racist way. a fine the highest we could apply is sufficient punishment. suspension would have been a bit exaggerated flores told sports daily marca.
224,eu-us seeking deal on air dispute the eu and us have agreed to begin talks on ending subsidies given to aircraft makers eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has announced. both sides hope to reach a negotiated deal over state aid received by european aircraft maker airbus and its us rival boeing mr mandelson said. airbus and boeing accuse each other of benefiting from illegal subsidies. mr mandelson said the eu and us hoped to avoid having to resolve the dispute at the world trade organisation (wto). with this agreement the eu and us have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute which has arisen between them mr mandelson said. i hope our negotiations in the next three months will lead to an agreement ending subsidies to development and production of large civil aircraft. last year the us terminated an agreement with the eu reached in which limits the subsidies countries can hand over to civil aircraft makers. the us filed a complaint against brussels with the wto over state aid to airbus prompting a retaliatory eu complaint over us support for boeing. however both sides agreed to suspend their requests for wto arbitration at the beginning of december to allow bilateral talks to continue. eads and bae systems the european defence and aerospace firms which own airbus welcomed mr mandelson s announcement. it has always been preferable that any differences between the us and europe on this matter be overcome through constructive discussion rather than through legal recourse the companies said in a joint statement. separately the world s largest package delivery company ups said it had placed an order for airbus superjumbo freight-carrying jets with an option to buy more of the triple-decker aircraft. the us company said it needed to expand its air freight capacity following strong international growth and would begin receiving deliveries of the from . however ups said it was cutting a previous order for smaller airbus from planes to . so far airbus has delivered to ups. airbus overtook boeing as the world s largest manufacturer of commercial airliners in .

402,warnings about junk mail deluge the amount of spam circulating online could be about to undergo a massive increase say experts. anti-spam group spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail. the program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out. spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent. before now many spammers have recruited home pcs to act as anonymous e-mail relays in an attempt to hide the origins of their junk mail. the pcs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program. once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers. spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines. but the novel worm spotted recently by spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place. in this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate. as blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped. steve linford director of spamhaus predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net s e-mail sending infrastructure. david stanley uk managing director of filtering firm ciphertrust said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers. they are adding to their armoury he said. the amount of spam in circulation was still growing said mr stanley but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e-mail meltdown. but kevin hogan senior manager at symantec security response said such warnings were premature. if something like this mean the end of e-mail then e-mail would have stopped two-three years ago said mr hogan. while the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too. mr hogan said % of the junk mail filtered by symantec subsidiary brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses. for instance said mr hogan filtering out e-mail messages that contain a web link can stop about % of spam.
2053,domain system opens door to scams a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers a trade body has warned. the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language. registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers says stephen dyer director of ukif. domain names are the real language addresses of websites rather than their internet protocol address which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so for example website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian a look just like an english a . but the computer code would be different and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent mr dyer said. although the idn problem is well known in technical circles the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked said mr dyer. it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site he added. there are solutions. for instance browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world s browsers. another solution to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water he said. centr the council of european national top level domain registries agrees. a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world the organisation said in a statement.
1503,kennedy calls for iraq exit plans tony blair should set out a proper exit strategy from iraq in the wake of next sunday s elections in the country lib dem leader charles kennedy has said. in a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of george w bush mr kennedy said iraq had become a crucible of militant terrorism . he wants to see a phased withdrawal of uk troops as soon as the situation allows he said in london. any exit strategy must augment and support the democratic process. there are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of british and american troops in iraq feeds the insurgency he said. there is some truth in that especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like fallujah and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces. mr kennedy pointed out that the netherlands portugal and the czech republic which all have troops operating in the southern sector of iraq have announced their imminent withdrawal regardless of the situation on the ground . he accused mr blair s government of being less than straightforward over its plans. next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in iraq mr kennedy said during his city of london speech. he should set out a proper exit strategy including the phased withdrawal of british troops as the security situation allows. mr kennedy also argued that british troops deployed in iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - especially islamic countries .

639,asia shares defy post-quake gloom thailand has become the first of the southern asian nations battered by giant waves at the weekend to cut its economic forecast. thailand s economy is now expected to grow by .% in rather than % as forecast before tsunamis hit six tourist provinces. the full economic costs of the disaster remain unclear. in part this is because of its scale and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. but indonesian indian and hong kong stock markets reached record highs on wednesday suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact. the highs showed the gap in outlook between investors in large firms and individuals who have lost their livelihoods. investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas - such as aceh in indonesia - were so under-developed that the tragedy would little impact on asia s listed companies according to analysts. obviously with a lot of loss of life a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess bury the people and find the missing. but it s not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense said abn amro chief asian strategist eddie wong. india s bombay stock exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on wednesday. expectations of strong corporate earnings in drove the indonesian stock exchange in jakarta to a record high on wednesday. in hong kong the hang seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of south east asia. in sri lanka some economists have said that as much as % of annual growth may be lost. sri lanka s stock market has fallen about % since the weekend but it is still % higher than at the start of . thailand may lose baht (£; $) in earnings from tourism over the next three months according to tourism minister sontaya kunplome. in the affected provinces he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around baht - on the rebuilding work. it will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level said naris chaiyasoot director general at the ministry s fiscal policy office. in the maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth according to a government spokesman. our nation is in peril here said ahmed shaheed the chief government spokesman. he estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. the maldives has gross domestic product of $. it won t be surprising if the cost exceeds our gdp he said. in the last few years we made great progress in our standard of living - the united nations recognised this. now we see this can disappear in a few days a few minutes. shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $. between and of the -odd resorts have been severely damaged and a similar number have suffered significant damage. however many experts including the world bank have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact.
1800,microsoft makes anti-piracy move microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its windows operating system by restricting their access to security features. the windows genuine advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-. it will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates but their options would be limited . microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect pcs. either pcs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through microsoft s site. those running pirated windows programs would not have access to other downloads and add-ons that the software giant offers. people who try to manually download security patches will have to let microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number. microsoft s regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms viruses and other threats penetrating pcs. some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats with more pcs left unprotected. but graham cluley senior consultant at security firm sophos told the bbc news website that it was a positive decision. it sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of windows is good news for everyone who uses the net he said. windows genuine advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in september for english-language versions of windows. microsoft s windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. the company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. software piracy has cost the company billions it says. the company announced earlier in january that it was releasing security tools to clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware which % of pcs are infected with. the virus-fighting program updated monthly is a precursor to microsoft s dedicated anti-virus software. last year it introduced the windows xp counterfeit project a uk-based pilot scheme which ran from november to december. the scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november could replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones for free. it is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in china norway and the czech republic where pirated software is a huge problem by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies windows. china in particular is a problem with piracy estimated at % said mr cluley.

1689,brown shrugs off economy fears gordon brown is to freeze petrol duty increases fund a £ package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave. in an upbeat pre-budget report he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. the chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in uk industrial history but denied he was gloating . but oliver letwin for the tories attacked government red tape and debt dubbing mr brown sir wastealot . the shadow chancellor said mr brown s golden rule had turned to dross in his hands and said he was borrowing to spend not invest with predicted debt over the coming years totalling £. mr letwin told mps: the tide is going out on the chancellor s credibility. he is spending borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer s money. vincent cable for the liberal democrats accused mr brown of ducking tough choices. he said: last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency. there are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the uk housing market and rising personal debt. but they have not been confronted. mr brown rejected the lib dem s call to open up the government s books to the national audit office saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. bbc economic editor evan davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble. mr brown s insistence he was not gloating was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new european commissioner peter mandelson. in his speech he set out a -year childcare strategy for if labour wins the next election. it includes a £ cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. he also promised to increase free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to hours from april . and funds would be provided to keep schools open from to to look after children while their parents were at work. taken together the measures would create a welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history said mr brown. he also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners with payments of £ for the over- as part of the winter fuel allowance. in a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below % next year the chancellor said he was providing an extra £ for local councils. the money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education. mr brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt low and sustainable - both in this economic cycle and the next. borrowing figures for / are £ - £. less than the £. predicted in march s budget as already announced by the office for national statistics. borrowing is tipped to fall to £ by / - but that is still £ more than mr brown predicted in his march budget. inflation would be .% next year and % in the years to follow mr brown forecast. he also pledged an extra £ for security and counter-terrorism. business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. but there worries about the costs of more family-friendly working. simon sweetman from the federation of small businesses said: the proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers.
1127,my memories of marley... to mark the anniversary of the birth of reggae star bob marley rob partridge - marley s former head of press at island records - remembers the man behind the legend. partridge worked with marley from until the jamaican musician s death in . : i joined island records in and the first week i was there i worked on his show at the rainbow theatre. it was one of the last dates he did in london. : the album exodus came out in and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status. by he was the biggest touring attraction in the world. i remember going to see dates in milan and turin and they were enormous concerts. : bob was one of the most mesmeric people i ve ever had the privilege to work with. he must have had an iron will to succeed. bob was a very driven individual. you realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in. he didn t suffer fools gladly. at the risk of stating the obvious he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest i ve ever seen. i saw him many times. : i recall in he came to the uk for top of the pops and a daily mirror journalist did a half-hour interview. it was interrupted to do a rehearsal. he came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a world cup match on tv. he sat down in front of the tv and after minutes it was obvious he wasn t going to move. that was the end of it. the mirror had a very truncated interview. the last time i saw him was in london in . i arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in fulham. bob was a good player. we are talking about jamaican-style football. he was an attacking midfield player. his team assembled wherever his gigs were. we played in brazil against some world cup-winning players. : it was always a struggle for him to connect with black america. reggae did not correspond with disco in the . but bob in the became one of the great icons in america and the third world. in ten years after his death he sold more records than at any time during his life. we saw black america taking bob into their hearts for the first time. : bob in worldwide terms is the greatest music star there has ever been. if you went to africa he would be recognised everywhere in places john lennon or elvis wouldn t be. no disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest the best and the most influential artist in popular music. : well was to be the year he toured africa with stevie wonder. he had only performed in zimbabwe and guinea before. of course the tour never happened but the whole of africa would have embraced him. we can t speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just years old. i had no sense his career was going to go downhill. : bob was endlessly optimistic about the way africa would turn out. he realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind. i m sure if he were alive today he would believe africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the aids epidemic. : the final tune of his final album was redemption song - one of the most incredible classics of all time.

1630,ukip mep attacked german empire a uk independence party mep suggested germany saw the eu as an empire and was cheaper than using tanks a new documentary has revealed. mike nattrass ukip s deputy leader made the comments to an audience at a meeting during last september s hartlepool by-election campaign. but challenged on the remark he denied accusing germany of using the eu as cover for a german reich . he says he was not german-bashing but saying peace was the eu s founding aim. the meeting was shown in a bbc film on ex-ukip mep robert kilroy-silk. the former chat show host quit the party earlier this month calling it a joke. the documentary showed mr nattrass apparently talking about the eu telling the meeting: the germans are the big losers here but they don t care because to them the project is worthwhile. it s like an empire for them spreading in all directions away from germany into hungary into what they call the sudetenland - czechoslovakia places like that. so it s cheaper for them to do it this way than roll the tanks in. on tuesday he told the bbc news website he did not think the comments were offensive and worked happily with meps of different nationalities in the european parliament. he argued that peace was the only reason for having the outdated eu as there was no economic justification. pointing to germany s trade interests as a country in the centre of europe mr nattrass said: the fact is that the eu benefits germany but it does not benefit britain. i m not at all german-bashing. it s the truth. a ukip spokesman said: mike has some passionate beliefs and sometimes uses excessively colourful language with which to express them. the documentary showed some of the tensions between mr kilroy-silk and his fellow meps after ukip took third place in last year s european elections. he denied wanting to be leader until october when he told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme he aspired to the job. asked by the documentary makers why he had lied about his leadership ambitions mr kilroy-silk said: there was one thing i said that i shouldn t have said at the time. i was trying to be helpful to the party and it was the wrong thing to do i should have told the truth. the film also included footage of a row between mr kilroy-silk mep nigel farage and party leader roger knapman about rumours that he was about to resign the ukip whip in the european parliament. mr kilroy-silk told them he had not left the ukip group - a move he announced shortly after the meeting. he told mr farage: don t tell lies nigel now you ve told too many. most of the trouble had been caused by you. ukip officials claim it was in fact mr kilroy-silk not mr farage who briefed newspapers he was leaving the group of meps. later in unguarded off-air comments in a television studio mr kilroy-silk was heard saying he was irritated by defending some of these right-wing fascist nutters . mr kilroy-silk separately said he had argued against ukip working with such groups which believed homosexuality was a sin. a ukip spokesman said there were more than meps in the same group in the european parliament. they were from a broad spectrum - some right-wing some left-wing - but with a shared belief in the unfeasibility of the eu as it is now . he did not defend other groups religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views - just as mr kilroy-silk had a right to criticise arab states. london ukip mep gerard batten said: robert has made a variety of comments about ukip and its meps. there are of course two sides to every story. what robert does not say is that he was offered several positions which would have given him effective control of the party but not the title of leader. mr kilroy-silk is to launch his own parry veritas in westminster on wednesday.
2223,how political squabbles snowball it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering. but this analysis in fact gets it wrong. it s not just children who fight - adults do too. and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word. each participant genuinely wants the row to stop but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (in the case of mr blair and mr brown successive books are published ensuring the issues never die.) now this isn t because the participants are stupid - it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally given the incentives facing them. indeed there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. nothing as obscure as post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with. it s often referred to as the prisoner s dilemma based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime and are locked up in separate cells. but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. without a confession the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge. clearly the prisoners best strategy is to keep their mouths shut and take the short sentence but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. he tells each prisoner separately that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they ll be let off their crime. and he tells them that if they don t confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they ll get life. now if you are prisoner confronted with this choice your best bet is to confess. if your partner doesn t confess you ll get off completely. and if your partner does confess you d better confess to ensure you don t get life. the result is of course both prisoners confess so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. both prisoners individual logic was to behave that way even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. don t worry if you don t entirely follow it - you can to look it up on google where there are entries on it. the prisoners dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly. a cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms rather than a lot of arms. but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms results in arms levels that are too high. what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it. it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. somehow the incentives have to change. in the case of the labour party if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. an example is the famous rule that one divides the other chooses as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. in the case of an apparently endless argument if you want it to come to an end you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing or one more book for that matter has to exceed the benefit of having the last word and getting your point in. if the rest of the party can enforce that they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.

1967,brainwave cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer. four people two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with electrodes. previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. the results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. the research team from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought. the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which meant no surgery or implantation was needed. brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. the impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis said the researchers. the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. earlier this year a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.
899,williams stays on despite dispute matt williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as a result of the power struggle currently gripping scottish rugby. the chairman chief executive and three non-executive directors all departed in a row over the game s future direction. but williams said: i want to make it clear that i m committed totally to scottish rugby. i ve brought my family here and we ve immersed ourselves in scottish life. there s no way that i m walking away. however he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute. i d like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation he said. when you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make a difference then there are always people who will begrudge you who are jealous and want to try to drag you down. when you have that situation you have to have the courage of your convictions to see it through. there was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of scottish rugby and that is simply not the case. like all good coaches you go and ask for an increase. but we were told in no uncertain terms that the financial situation did not allow that. the idea that we are lighting cigars with £ notes while the rest of scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue. we also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team. but let me give you the truth. our irish counterparts whom we have to compete with in a few days time had days together at the summer. they are currently in camp now and they will have another days in camp before the six nations. that means they will have days away from their club from july until the six nations. we on the other hand will have . there must be a win-win philosophy and attitude within scottish rugby and that is what we are after - both groups winning not competing.

346,visa decision every minutes visa processing staff are sometimes expected to rule on an application every minutes mps have said. pressure was placed on staff to be efficient rather than to do a thorough examination of an application the public accounts committee found. every officer had an annual target of applications - equivalent to a day or one every minutes. mps want research into whether uk visa holders leave at the end of their stays or vanish into the black market. committee chairman edward leigh said: there is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued. entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents. the committee s report also discussed the romanian and bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister beverley hughes last year. committee members said the home office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused. investigations carried out in the wake of ms hughes resignation found more than people had entered the uk under the business visa scheme for romanian and bulgarian entrepreneurs . mr leigh said the home office should now consider removing those who had not set up a valid business. a home office spokesman said the system had been toughened and tightened since the investigation. he added that the traditional system of a dual decision making process for all pre-entry applications will be replaced by a single pre-entry check at post which will be simpler and more robust against abuse than the current system .
322,bank opts to leave rates on hold the bank of england has left interest rates on hold at .% for a sixth month in a row. the bank s monetary policy committee (mpc) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. but some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. interest rates rose five times between november and august as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. bank of england governor mervyn king has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month s economic data suggesting the mpc is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. economists see next week s inflation report from the mpc as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check. slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the mpc that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. inflation however has been rising faster than expected hitting an annual rate of .% in december - its highest level in six months. data on wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since may last month reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts. and recent house surveys from the halifax and nationwide have indicated prices are still rising albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. philip shaw chief economist at investec securities said he believed rates would remain at .% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. the economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months he said. growth appears stronger and the mpc may become more concerned about inflation trends. howard archer economist at global insight said the mpc may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside . business groups welcomed the mpc s widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. the british chambers of commerce (bcc) said it was concerned by the clamour in some quarters for early interest rate increases. we believe that these demands should be firmly resisted said david frost bcc director general. manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly in spite of the recent revised figures. ian mccafferty chief economist at the cbi said the mpc faced an interesting challenge. consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling he said. however the broader economy continues to show healthy growth and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.
