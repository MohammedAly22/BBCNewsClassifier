1864,latest opera browser gets vocal net browser opera . due for official release at the end of next month will be the most accessible browser on the market according to its authors. the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. the voice features based on ibm technology are currently only available in the windows version. opera can also magnify text by up to times and users can create style sheets its developers say. this will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone said opera spokeswoman berit hanson. so we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users. another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling. the company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using opera with a handheld device. the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural said ms hanson. people are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard so this makes the web a more hands-free experience. unlike commercially available voice recognition software opera does not have to be trained to recognise an individual voice. around voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. the voice recognition function is currently only available in english. opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from norwegian telecoms company telenor. its browser is used by an estimated million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.
1211,qatar and shell in $ gas deal shell has signed a $ (£.) deal with the middle eastern sheikhdom of qatar to supply liquid natural gas (lng) to north america and europe. the uk-dutch group will own % of the project with qatar s state oil firm owning the rest. the agreement is the latest in a string of deals reached by qatar which is trying to make itself a regional leader in natural gas. us oil giant exxonmobil signed up for a $. deal earlier on sunday. france s total is expected to join the exxonmobil scheme dubbed qatargas- on monday taking million tonnes of lng a year. exxonmobil will be taking some million tonnes each year for years from the end of under the deal. shell s agreement under the name qatargas- foresees the building of new facilities to handle . billion cubic feet of gas and . million tonnes of lng each year from onwards.
1405,greek sprinters won t run again the careers of sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are over says the boss of the organisation that cleared them of missing a drugs test. greek athletics federation boss vassilli sevastis told the country s parliament: i believe kenteris and thanou won t race again. the damage to their commercial interests has been done he added. athletics bosses are considering its reponse to the ruling while the athletes face a trial in a greek court. greek prosecutors have brought spearate charges of missing the drugs test and faking a motorcycle accident. speaking to the greek parliament on tuesday sevastis said that the evidence sent by the international olympic committee and athletics governing body the iaaf was not strong enough for the greek association to find the sprinters guilty. we were given the task of getting the snake out if its hole but we were not given any evidence to do it with he said. so how can you as a greek with your hand on your heart try the athletes he added. the athletes are technically free to compete while the iaaf reviews its response to the decision to clear kenteris and thanou. but sevastis said: it does not matter if they are found guilty at the court of arbitration for sport and the current decision is reversed.
1119,tarantino to direct csi episode film director quentin tarantino is to direct an episode of us television series csi: crime scene investigation. the oscar-winning pulp fiction director has also written an original story for the season finale episode. csi s co-producer carol mendelsohn said the episode would have more bugs and blood than usual. it is not tarantino s first venture into tv. in he directed an episode of the medical drama er and has also appeared in alias. ms mendelsohn said the production team had been trying for a while to get tarantino to direct an episode of csi and added that he was a fan of the forensic drama. she said he finally agreed a few weeks ago while csi was doing some location shooting in las vegas and the show s stars persuaded him. he knows everything there is to know about csi and he is into the whole mythology of csi mendelsohn said. quentin came in a couple of weeks ago. we had a story meeting with the writers. he had a great idea and it was so much fun to have him in the room... we are positively giddy. filming is due to start in early april and the tarantino-directed episode will be broadcast in the us on may.
399,lib dems bold election policy charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an honest choice at the next general election. with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation. it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two. with his party s previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government he has switched tack. now he is promising to levy a modest increase of the same amount on earnings over £ a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges. they are to scrap student fees finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. that last policy will also see about % of the most well off paying more while others pensioners in particular will pay less. labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed. inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services. the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through £ efficiency savings while labour has offered £ savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals although there is little chance they will propose increases. in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the and early . but unlike the old tory-labour debate he believes voters are ready to see modest tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services. that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts. similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking michael howard s proposals for quotas. once again with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration mr kennedy is stressing the different more liberal approach of his party. mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party s election chances declaring the tories were not going to be significant players in the poll. he repeated his pledge not to do post-election deals with either party after the election. mr kennedy went on to suggest the re-election of a labour government with a small majority would amount to a massive vote of no confidence in tony blair s government. that suggests the lib dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful even pivotal position in a vastly different house of commons after the next election. it is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before.
1662,delta cuts fares in survival plan delta air lines is cutting domestic fares by as much as % as part of a plan to ensure its financial survival. other us carriers including united have sought bankruptcy protection amid high fuel costs and competition from discount carriers. delta is restructuring in a bid to fight off insolvency. this latest move to boost business has prompted speculation other firms will be forced to match their fares hurting revenues in the sector. delta s new simplifares were trialled from august last year on tickets from cincinnati its second-largest hub. the airline says no one-way economy fare will now be priced higher than $ (£) and no first-class fare will be priced higher than $. it is also eliminating a saturday-night stay requirement on discount fares and will give further reductions to customers opting for non-refundable tickets booking in advance and online. delta which lost $ in the three months to september was forced to cut jobs worldwide as part of its aim to slash $ from its costs. in october it reached a crucial agreement with pilots on pay and conditions and it has also issued new shares to staff in return for wage cuts. airline shares closed lower on the announcement with delta continental and american airlines all falling by more than %. we believe the whole airline industry will now have to move in this direction; this will likely hurt revenue in the short run but could be beneficial in the long run said analyst ray neidl at calyon securities.
1622,uk world s biggest music buyer uk consumers are the biggest music buyers in the world according to new figures released on tuesday by the british phonographic industry (bpi). but global sales of recorded music were flat in with growing sales in dvd music videos offset by online and physical piracy in major markets. the uk music industry recorded an overall % increase in volume sales mostly due to its robust albums market. however world music sales declined by .% to $. billion (£. billion). the uk cd albums market grew by .% in with a record . million units sold. on average every briton buys . cds per person per year. around albums are released in the uk each year making britain second only to the us in terms of the number of releases. overall sales were driven by new uk-signed artists such as keane katie melua and scissor sisters whose debut album sold almost . million copies in the uk. a slew of great new british artists have met uk music fans demand for great music said bpi chairman peter jameson. the best-selling album globally was usher s confessions - one of eight albums to sell more than five million copies in . the growth in the dvd market and a sharp increase in sales of digital music ensured a strong market in the us. the total number of tracks downloaded last year were up more than tenfold on . digital sales in the us in the first two months of are already more than double that of the same period in . however some markets in continental europe and asia - notably sweden finland france spain and south korea - have been drastically hit by internet piracy. australia italy and the netherlands also saw a decline. on the positive side digital sales are booming said john kennedy chief executive of the international federation of phonographic industries (ifpi). however commercial piracy and illegal file-sharing are continuing to depress our markets. the priority in the coming year is to step up the advance of legitimate digital sales and sustain our anti-piracy efforts. the main choice today s music fan now has to make is whether to get music legally or illegally added mr jameson.
1919,iraqis win death test case probe the family of an iraqi civilian allegedly killed by uk troops have won a challenge against the government s refusal to order a full inquiry. the high court ruled on tuesday that baha mousa s death in british custody in iraq fell within the european convention on human rights. and the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate. but judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern iraq were ruled out. their families will be appealing against the judgement. the families solicitor phil shiner described it as a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the uk . father-of-two mr mousa a hotel receptionist was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in basra in september . he was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the queen s lancashire regiment. the iraqi families lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the european convention on human rights. ministry of defence lawyers argued the uk-controlled area of southern iraq was outside european jurisdiction. but lord justice rix and mr justice forbes ruled that uk jurisdiction could extend to a uk-run prison but did not apply to the total territory of another state . they said as mr mousa was in custody when he died his case came within the uk s jurisdiction. the other five iraqis did not die in custody so their cases had to fail they said. and it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred has been timely open or effective the judges said. after the ruling carla ferstman legal director of the human rights organisation redress said: it is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors. there must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body. only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible. other allegations involving british soldiers included the shooting of an iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four iraqi civilians in may . both sides were granted permission to appeal. prime minister tony blair s official spokesman said: obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment. i would point out however that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority. i can t say anything further for obvious reasons. the mod are considering whether to appeal. but former british commander colonel bob stewart said : anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: if there s a case to answer let s have it out. because we don t want people thinking that british soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it he said. the ministry of defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war.
86,uk pledges £ to vaccine effort uk chancellor gordon brown has offered £ ($.) over years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes. in a speech he called for action to reach the millennium declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. mr brown has just returned from a tour of african nations. the £ commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief trade aid education and health. the chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the uk s department for international development and the un development programme on wednesday. mr brown welcomed news that the bill gates foundation and norway are joining up to put an extra £. ($ ) into the global alliance for vaccines and immunisation (gavi). britain france gavi and the gates foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the international finance facility (iff) to the area of immunisation. that could see donors making long-term legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. as well as pledging £ over years to the immunisation iff britain urged other donors to contribute. if gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £ ($.) over years then an extra five million lives could have been saved by and five million thereafter mr brown argued. campaign groups including friends of the earth the world development movement and war on want said uk government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. war on want s john hilary said: compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government s neo-liberal policies. as long as mr blair and mr brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty not lifted out of it.

186,deutsche boerse set to woo lse bosses of deutsche boerse and the london stock exchange are to meet amid talk that a takeover bid for the lse will be raised to £. ($.). last month the german exchange tabled a pence-per-share offer for lse valuing it at £.. paris-based euronext owner of liffe in london has also said it is interested in bidding for lse. euronext is due to hold talks with lse this week and it is reported to be ready to raise £. to fund a bid. euronext chief jean-francois theodore is scheduled to meet his lse counterpart clara furse on friday. deutsche boerse chief werner seifert is meeting ms furse on thursday in the third meeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in december. the lse rejected deutsche boerse s proposed £. offer in december saying it undervalued the business. but it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a significantly-improved proposal would be in the interests of lse s shareholders and customers. in the meantime euronext which combines the paris amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges also began talks with the lse. in a statement on thursday euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash but added that: there can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made. a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in europe and the second biggest in the world after the new york stock exchange. according to the ft in its latest meeting deutsche boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the london exchange. the newspaper said the german suitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of london and let ms furse take the helm. other reports this week said the deutsche boerse might even consider selling its luxembourg-based clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions. its ownership of clearstream was seen as the main stumbling block to a london-frankfurt merger. lse shareholders feared a deutsche boerse takeover would force them to use clearstream making it difficult for them to negotiate for lower transaction fees.

652,supercomputer breaks speed record the us is poised to push japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibm s prototype blue gene/l machine. it is being assembled for the lawrence livermore national laboratory a us department of energy (doe) lab. doe test results show that blue gene/l has managed speeds of . teraflops. the current top machine japan s nec earth simulator clocks up .. due next week the top list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. it is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack which measures calculations per second. the speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles. the us secretary of energy spencer abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed according to the linpack benchmark. until the official list is published however blue gene/l s position will not be confirmed and there are expected to be some other new entries. but the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement. surpassing the trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time. the ibm blue gene/l is only a prototype and is one the speed of the full version due to be completed for the livermore labs in . its peak theoretical performance is expected to be teraflops and will fit into full racks. it will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power a big problem for supercomputers. the final machine will help scientists work out the safety security and reliability requirements for the us s nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for underground nuclear testing. the earth simulator has held on to the top spot since june . it is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. but in september ibm said that another blue gene/l machine clocked up . teraflops marginally surpassing the earth simulator s performance. this was achieved during internal testing at ibm s production facility in rochester minnesota though so was not an official record. another giant to enter the fray is silicon graphics columbia supercomputer based at nasa s ames research center in california. it would be used to model flight missions climate research and aerospace engineering. the linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of . teraflops in october. supercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society. their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts help design better cars and improve disease diagnosis. ibm s senior vice president of technology and manufacturing nick donofrio believes that by blue gene will be capable of petaflop computing. this means it would be capable of doing trillion operations a second. when you get a computer as large as a petaflop you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world mr donofrio recently told the bbc news website. you can start to be more proactive more interactive and more innovative. one area where mr donofrio sees supercomputing - and blue gene machines in particular - as crucial is health. he believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the century: protein folding. health is one of the most important problems not just mapping the human genome but also protein structures. we are a great believer in simulation. it gives you another tool he said. once the structures of proteins are understood fully then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively. compared with the current fastest supercomputers blue gene is designed to consume one the power and be times more compact. since the first supercomputer the cray- was installed at los alamos national laboratory in computational speed has leaped times. the cray- was capable of megaflops ( million operations a second). the blue gene/l machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. started in the top list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. it is presented at the international supercomputer conference in pittsburgh.

1431,chelsea ridiculed over complaint barcelona assistant coach henk ten cate has branded chelsea s expected complaint to uefa as pathetic . the blues are poised to complain about an alleged half-time incident during wednesday s - loss at the nou camp. the source of chelsea s anger was an alleged talk between barca boss frank rijkaard and referee anders frisk who later dismissed didier drogba. to react the way chelsea have is pathetic. mourinho lied with the line-ups and now this ten cate said. uefa has said its own tunnel representative witnessed nothing unusual out of the ordinary during the half-time break. spokesman william gaillard said: frisk says rijkaard greeted him and apologised he had not had the opportunity to say hello before the game. we had two uefa officials there and neither witnessed it. the referee s dressing room was locked and he and his assistants were the only people allowed in. indeed it is the londoners who could be on the receiving end of any punishment after failing to turn up for the compulsory press conference after the defeat. uefa delegate thomas giordano added: the only unusual thing that happened as far as we are concerned is that chelsea failed to present themselves in the press conference. the referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to uefa - weakening chelsea s case. rijkaard was critical of mourinho s decision not to speak to the media after the match. there was a lot of talking before the game and now surprisingly there is a lot of talking after the game. it is not good behaviour after a match he said. maybe they want to start something and make it worse than than it is. i really don t understand it. i am very calm about it. barca midfielder deco formerly managed by mourinho at porto agreed that it was not typical of his fellow portuguese to lodge a protest. it s not normal behaviour on his part. it was not logical he did not give a news conference he said. rijkaard added: chelsea is the team which has conceded fewest goals in the english league and they defend very well so i am very pleased with the win. my men deserved victory and i am pleased to have won this match. i congratulate my players.
1100,bbc poll indicates economic gloom citizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a bbc world service poll believe the world economy is worsening. most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse. but when asked about their own family s financial outlook a majority in countries said they were positive about the future. almost people in countries were questioned for the poll which was mostly conducted before the asian tsunami disaster. the poll found that a majority or plurality of people in countries believed the economy was going downhill compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. those surveyed in three countries were split. in percentage terms an average of % of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse compared to % who said it was improving. similarly % were pessimistic about their national economy while % were optimistic. and % saw their family s economic conditions improving as against % who said they were getting worse. the poll of people was conducted by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes (pipa) at the university of maryland. while the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago people seem to not have fully absorbed this development though they are personally experiencing its effects said pipa director steven kull. people around the world are saying: i m ok but the world isn t . there may be a perception that war terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance says the bbc s elizabeth blunt. the countries where people were most optimistic both for the world and for their own families were two fast-growing developing economies china and india followed by indonesia. china has seen two decades of blistering economic growth which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale says the bbc s louisa lim in beijing. but the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country s rosy economic future our correspondent says. south korea was the most pessimistic while respondents in italy and mexico were also quite gloomy. the bbc s david willey in rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. the philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents families but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. pipa conducted the poll from november to january across countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. the interviews took place between november and january . the margin of error is between . and points depending on the country. in eight of the countries the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas.
70,wales must learn health lessons the new health minister for wales says there are lessons to learn from england in tackling waiting lists. dr brian gibbons on his first full day in the job after jane hutt was sacked admitted big challenges but insisted the essentials were in place. but both plaid cymru and the liberal democrats said dr gibbons needed to change policy. meanwhile ms hutt defended her record saying waiting times and lists were only % of the health agenda. dr gibbons who was a gp in blaengwynfi in the upper afan valley before becoming am for aberavon said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after tremendous change and reform . one of the biggest problems which had faced ms hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly s first health minister was the length of waiting lists in wales. in november the british medical association said nhs staff were weeping with despair as figures showed people were waiting for treatment in wales up by on the previous month. in the same month lists in england were at their lowest for years with people waiting for treatment. dr gibbons told radio wales: there is no doubt that in managing waiting lists england has done a lot of very very useful work and we do need to learn from that. but he said the nhs in wales also needed to create a healthier population rather than respond only to ill health and a balanced view of priorities was important. we do need a consistent across-the-board approach recognising the patients experience of how they use the service is going to be at the end of the day the main test of how the service is working. he said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after tremendous change and reform . later dr gibbons praised the work of ms hutt saying he agreed with everything she s done to change the health service in wales. dr gibbons said he accepted there was a problem but his job now was to build on the foundations put in place by his predecessor. he also acknowledged that until the waiting list issue was sorted out the rest of the assembly government s health policy would be overshadowed. opposition members and some labour mps had long called for ms hutt s removal after sustained criticism over extended hospital waiting times. first minister rhodri morgan told bbc wales he had agreed with ms hutt in that she would not be health minister in the run-up to the elections. she s been doing the job for five years and eight months and apart from nye bevan himself (architect of the nhs) i don t think anybody has ever done the job for so long. mr morgan said he had only told ms hutt of the reshuffle on monday morning and said the nhs in wales was dr gibbons baby now. in response to dr gibbons comments ieuan wyn jones leader of the plaid cymru group in the assembly said: it is apparent that this reshuffle by the first minister was just changing the deckchairs on a sinking titanic. kisrty williams for the lib dems added: if the underlying policy is going to continue then changing the minister will serve no purpose other than to deflect flak from labour s mps she said. meanwhile ms hutt said she hoped that the people of wales would benefit from my investment of the past five years and eight months asked about waiting lists she said that waiting times and lists were only % of the health agenda and that the welsh assembly government had turned the corner on the issue.
936,charvis set to lose fitness bid flanker colin charvis is unlikely to play any part in wales final two games of the six nations. charvis has missed all three of wales victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected. he will not figure in the scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game said wales physio mark davies. sonny parker is continuing to struggle with a neck injury but hal luscombe should be fit for the murrayfield trip. centre parker has only a slim chance of being involved against the scots on march so luscombe s return to fitness after missing the france match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost. said wales assistant coach scott johnson: we re positive about hal and hope he ll be raring to go. he comes back into the mix again adds to the depth and gives us other options. replacement hooker robin mcbryde remains a doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in paris last saturday. we re getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how robin s looking added johnson. we re hopeful but it s too early to say at this stage. steve jones from the dragons is likely to be drafted in if mcbryde fails to recover.

1994,mourinho plots impressive course chelsea s win at fulham - confirming their position at the premiership summit - proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season. they have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match. all they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all. one thing is certain - they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed. they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge won at newcastle in the carling cup and then won - at fulham which was a great result given that they had been showing good form. as i said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now. mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the champions league and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players. it is a priceless commodity. no-one can be anything other than highly-impressed by mourinho. he is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk. mourinho doesn t simply talk a good game - he s won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto. some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions. i ve also found him to be very realistic whenever i ve heard him. he s spent a lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked. the buys are now integrating and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension. in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games. you cannot win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital. i also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful. now they are taking those chances have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things are looking good. i just wonder if they lack a predator particularly with didier drogba injured. he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if chelsea had a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title. chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league. i felt they would never have a better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season. it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of chelsea s squad. i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind. if anything what i have seen has confirmed my early impressions. and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenal s rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out - winners. mourinho had his say on that game complaining: five-four is a hockey score not a football score. in a three-against-three training match if the score reaches - i send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly. so to get a result like that in a game of against is disgraceful. on a more serious note it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal. much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan but i believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenal s defence. confidence is a crucial factor in defending. when you start conceding goals you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area. you think oh no - then find your worst fears confirmed. arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheets on the board. but the return of campbell is key. he solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck. he is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him. campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit. chelsea have no such problems at present which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season.
2193,us consumer confidence up consumers confidence in the state of the us economy is at its highest for five months and they are optimistic about an influential survey says. the feel-good factor among us consumers rose in december for the first time since july according to new data. the conference board survey of households pointed to renewed optimism about job creation and economic growth. us retailers have reported strong sales over the past days after a slow start to the crucial festive season. according to figures also released on tuesday sales in shopping malls in the week to december were .% higher than in following a last minute rush. wal-mart the largest us retailer has said its december sales are expected to be better than previously forecast because of strong post-christmas sales. it is expecting annual sales growth of between % and % for the month. consumer confidence figures are considered a key economic indicator because consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the united states. the continuing economic expansion combined with job growth has consumers ending this year on a high note said lynn franco director of the conference board s consumer research centre. and consumers outlook suggests that the economy will continue to expand in the first half of next year. the overall us economy has performed strongly in recent months prompting the federal reserve to increase interest rates five times since june.
986,video phone help for deaf people deaf people who prefer to communicate using british sign language (bsl) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter. the video relay service is being piloted by the royal national institute for deaf people (rnid) but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people s pockets. the rnid is urging telecoms regulator ofcom to reduce the cost of the service from the current £. per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. the service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a bsl interpreter via a webcam or video phone and the interpreter then relays the deaf person s conversation using a telephone and translates the other person s response into sign language. for many deaf people especially those born deaf bsl is a first and preferred means of communication. until now the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. in the past i ve used textphones but they have problems said robert currington who is taking part in the pilot. i communicate in bsl; my written english is not very good and it takes me longer to think in english and type my message. i sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply. the rnid says the uk is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. there are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people said rnid technology director guido gybels. in the us and australia sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. by failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group. ofcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. and new technology including the video relay service will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. but a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider he said. mr currington like many of the uk s bsl users will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. the relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure he said. i can show my emotions more easily in bsl in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.
1445,kennedy criticises unfair taxes gordon brown has failed to tackle the fundamental unfairness in the tax system in his ninth budget charles kennedy has said. how was it right that the poorest % of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest % the lib dem leader asked. the new £ council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the unfair tax he added. the government could not go on patching up the system he added. speaking in the commons after mr brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last budget before the general election mr kennedy acknowledged that the uk was one of the most successful economies in the world. but he criticised both the chancellor and the tories for failing to address the ticking bomb of council tax revaluation. he said the recent experience of wales indicated seven million households in england would pay significantly more after revaluation. the chancellor s announcement that he was to offer a £ council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a sticking plaster to a much bigger problem. the lib dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than £ a year with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off. on pensions mr kennedy said it was a scandal that the system discriminated against women who had missed making national insurance payments when they were having children. he said a residency criteria would end at a stroke this fundamental iniquity . mr kennedy added his party s priorities of free long-term care for the elderly abolishing top-up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging % income tax to those earning more than £ per annum. he contrasted his approach with mr brown s pledge in not to increase income tax. the chancellor went on to put up national insurance contributions after the election. for most individuals most families most households it adds up to exactly the same thing said mr kennedy. and they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election.
411,dutch bank to lay off staff abn amro the netherlands largest bank is to cut jobs as a result of falling profits. the cuts - amounting to % of the bank s workforce - will result in a one-off charge of euros ($.). about jobs will go in investment banking while and will go in it and human resources respectively. abn amro is the third large european bank to announce cutbacks in the past month following deutsche bank and credit suisse group. its profitability has been hit by a fall in mortgage lending in the united states - the bank s largest single market - following recent interest rate rises. abn amro s operations in the netherlands and the united kingdom will be hardest hit. jobs will also be lost in the us - which accounted for % of profit in the first half of - and across its operations in the americas and asia-pacific regions. the restructuring is designed to improve efficiency by reducing administrative costs and increasing focus on client service. the bank said it was on course for a % rise in net income this year but operating profits are set to fall because of a fall in us revenues. abn amro currently has more than staff. to get any profit growth in the coming years they will have to lower costs so shedding jobs makes total sense ivo geijsen an analyst with bank oyens & van eeghen told bloomberg. europe s leading banks seem set for a period of retrenchment. deutsche bank said earlier this month it would reduce its german workforce by while as many as jobs will be lost at credit suisse first boston.
969,steel firm to cut jobs mittal steel one of the world s largest steel producers could cut up to jobs over the next five years its chief executive has said. the netherlands-based company is due to complete its $. acquisition of us firm isg next month making it one of the largest global firms of its kind. however lakshmi mittal has told investors the combined company will have to shed thousands of jobs. the indian-born magnate did not say where the job losses would fall. mr mittal told us investors that once the acquisition of international steel group was completed the company would aim to reduce its workforce by between and annually. this could see its workforce trimmed from to staff by . we are investing in modernisation so employees will go down mr mittal told the conference in chicago. mittal steel was formed last year when mr mittal s lnm holdings merged with dutch firm ispat. a combination of mittal steel and isg would have annual sales of $ (£.; . euros) and a production capacity of million tonnes. a mittal steel spokeman said that no decisions on job cuts have been made yet. we are trying to create a sustainable steel industry and if we want to do that we have to invest in new technology a spokesman said. mittal steel has operations in countries. many of its businesses - particularly those in eastern europe - were previously state owned and have huge workforces. it employs staff in kazakhstan alone and has large operations in romania the czech republic south africa and the united states.
22,bates seals takeover ken bates has completed his takeover of leeds united. the -year-old former chelsea chairman sealed the deal at gmt on friday and has bought a % stake in the club. he said: i m delighted to be stepping up to the mantel at such a fantastic club. i recognise leeds as a great club that has fallen on hard times. we have a lot of hard work ahead to get the club back where it belongs in the premiership and with the help of our fans we will do everything we can. bates bought his stake under the guise of a geneva-based company known as the forward sports fund. he revealed that part of his plan is to buy back leeds elland road stadium and thorp arch training ground in due course. it s going to be a tough jon and the first task is to stabilise the cash flow and sort out the remaining creditors bates added. but there is light at the end of a very long tunnel. for the past year it has been a matter of firefighting - now we can start running the club again. outgoing leeds chairman gerald krasner said: this deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and i believe mr bates proposals are totally for the benefit of the club. we are content that under mr bates leeds united will continue to consolidate and move forward. when we took over leeds united in march the club had a debt of £ since that date my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under £. we worked tirelessly to solve all of the problems at leeds united. eighty percent of the problems have already been overcome and we came to this agreement with mr bates to secure its ongoing success. krasner revealed that his consortium has been asked to remain in the background at the club for an undisclosed period to help ensure a smooth hand-over. he will stay on in an unpaid capacity while peter lorimer will continue in his role as director and point of contact for the fans and peter mccormick will serve as a consultant to the incoming board. the other outgoing directors have agreed to leave their loans of £. in the company for the next four years. on leeds new-look board it is understood that lorimer will be joined by former chelsea finance director yvonne todd and bates lawyer mark taylor. krasner refused to give any details of the finances involved in the takeover. he told bbc five live: i am not going into the figures. if ken wants to give them up that is up to him. i can not tell you what the money will be used for. this dea l is not about money for the current board. in the last four months i never saw any cheques until this week from one person. i am not stretching figures we don t discuss internal arrangements. bates stepped down as chelsea chairman in march last year following roman abramovich s £ takeover at stamford bridge. in may he made a proposal to invest £ in sheffield wednesday but this was rejected by the club. sebastien sainsbury had been close to a takeover of leeds but withdrew his £ offer last week. his efforts failed after he revealed it would take £ to stage a takeover and that the club will also lose £ over the next six months. the club was on the brink of administration - and the deduction of points by the football league - before bates arrival but his investment has spared them that prospect.

1183,arthur hailey: king of the bestsellers novelist arthur hailey who has died at the age of was known for his bestselling page-turners exploring the inner workings of various industries from the hotels to high finance. born in luton bedfordshire on april hailey was the only child of working class parents they could not afford to keep him in school beyond the age of . he served as a pilot with the royal air force during world war ii flying fighter planes to the middle east. it was an occupation that was later to feature in his authorial debut the television screenplay flight into danger. hailey emigrated to canada in where he eventually became a citizen. he wanted to be a writer from an early age but did not take it up professionally until his mid-thirties when he was inspired to write his first screenplay while on a return flight to toronto. i fell to daydreaming. i visualised the pilots at the controls and wondered what would happen if they both got sick. could i fly the airplane i was a rusty wartime pilot who hadn t flown for nine years... hailey later recalled. the canadian broadcasting corporation bought flight into danger for $ (£) and it was shown on tv in april . it was later memorably spoofed in the comedy airplane! starring leslie nielsen. hailey worked as a screenwriter for a couple of years before turning to novels. he went on to produce best-selling books which were published into languages in countries. flight into danger was adapted to become hailey s first novel runaway zero-eight in . the final diagnosis and in high places followed both achieving a popular following. but it was not until hotel in that hollywood came calling. the hit novel took four years to write and stayed on national best-seller lists for a full year. it was turned into a movie in and later adapted into a glossy soap in the starring james brolin. airport () arguably remains hailey s best-loved work and prompted the disaster movie genre. the thriller follows events in the sky and on the ground at a snow-logged airport when a terrorist boards an airplane with a bomb. the book was adapted into a hit film in starring burt lancaster as the harassed aiport manager and dean martin as a womanising pilot alongside jean seberg and jacqueline bisset. in a testament to the popularity of the fledgling disaster genre - three sequels followed. the writer was known for his painstaking research into the professions around which each novel was centred drawing his characters from real life and taking up to three years to produce each book. i have never been able to write quickly or easily. i am too self-critical for that. i am never satisfied he once said. in he moved to nassau in the bahamas with his wife sheila. wheels () the moneychangers () and overload () followed. despite a lukewarm response from critics and few literary accolades hailey was at the height of his fame in the seventies and continued to attract the attention of hollywood producers. strong medicine hailey s blockbuster focusing on the pharmaceutical industry was turned into a film in starring sam neill douglas fairbanks jr and a panoply of former soap stars. the novel detective proved to be hailey s final book when at the age of he decided to retire. hailey s health began to deteriorate in recent years twice undergoing heart surgery. he suffered a stroke just two months ago. he died in his sleep on wednesday after dinner with his wife and two of his six children at his home in new providence island. he had a wonderful life. his greatest ambition was to see his name on a book and he certainly achieved that said his wife sheila.
1606,edu describes tunnel fracas arsenal s edu has lifted the lid on the scenes that followed manchester united s win over the gunners. the brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at united boss sir alex ferguson. i saw people being pulled apart people pushing pointing and shouting he told uefa s official website. the united players were trying to wind us up about the result but i didn t see any soup being thrown at anyone. however edu tried to play down the incidents adding: there was nothing that i haven t seen in brazilian derbies. derby matches in brazil are worse. i like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry. but edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of united s challenges during the game particularly on jose antonio reyes. i think we were a lot fairer in the tackles than united he said. reyes was being kicked all over the park - they were beating up the boy and gary neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent off. following the game the football association said it would look into events in the tunnel. it also charged ruud van nistelrooy with serious foul play while arsenal boss arsene wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee.
228,tv s future down the phone line internet tv has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now. but any early attempts to do it - the uk s home choice started in - were thwarted by the lack of a fast network. now that broadband networks are bedding down and it is becoming essential for millions the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line. in the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls they are keen to be the top iptv dogs. software giant microsoft thinks iptv - internet protocol tv - is the future of television and it sits neatly with its vision of the connected entertainment experience . telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time ed graczyk director of marketing for microsoft iptv told the bbc news website. the challenge has been the broadband network and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution. compression technology was not efficient enough the net was not good enough. a lot of stars have aligned in the last months to make it a reality. last year he said was all about deal making and partnering up; shaping the iptv ecosystem . this year those deals will start to play out and more services will come online. is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in south america and other parts of asia it will expand he added. what telcos really want to do is to send the triple-play of video voice and data down one single line be it cable or dsl (digital subscriber line). some are talking about quadruple play too with mobile services added into the mix. it is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators. according to technology analysts tdg research there will be million subscribers to iptv services in under six years. key to the appeal of sending tv programmes down the same line as the web data whenever a viewer wants it is that it uses the same technology as the internet. it means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the broadcaster . this allows for more dvd-like interactivity limitless storage and broadcast space bespoke channel playlists and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer s fingertips. it potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller niche or localised audiences sending films to bollywood fans for instance as well as individual devices. operators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver. perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking. currently there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite cable or freeview. with iptv the speed is milliseconds. that gets rounds of applause according to mr graczyk. microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about iptv some time ago. we believe this will be the way all tv is delivered in the future - but that is several years away said mr graczyk. as with music tv has moved to digital formats. the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv to the mobile to the gaming console and so on. the company intends its microsoft s iptv edition software an end-to-end management and delivery platform to let telcos to do exactly that seamlessly. it has netted seven major telcos as customers representing a potential audience of million existing broadband subscribers. its deal with us telco sbc was the largest tv software deal to date said mr graczyk. iptv is about more than telcos though. there are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net s power. jeremy allaire chief of brightcove told the bbc news website that it would be a flavour of iptv that was about harnessing the web as a channel . it is not just niches but about exploiting content not usually viewed he said. we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content and who often see unencumbered distribution. for them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive he said. this type of iptv service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives for instance. what is a clear sign that iptv has a future is that microsoft is not the only player in the field. there are a lot of other middleware players providing similar management services as microsoft like myrio and c-cor. but it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful.
316,takeover offer for sunderland fc bob murray chairman of sunderland fc has launched a £. ($.) bid for the club after buying broadcaster bskyb s stake in the business. mr murray is already sunderland s leading shareholder holding a .% stake and now hopes to take full control of the championship side. mr murray said the club would find it easier to attract more investment by having a single majority owner. sunderland delisted its shares from the stock market in august. a lifetime sunderland supporter and board director since mr murray agreed to buy bskyb s .% holding in the wearside club on tuesday - taking his stake to .%. under stock market rules mr murray is required to make an offer for the remaining shares that he does not already own at the same price paid for the bskyb holding of a share. should the offer be fully accepted mr murray said he expected to pay a maximum of £. for the remaining shares. he also stressed that fans who wanted to keep in touch with the club s financial affairs could retain a small number of shares enabling them to attend annual meetings. the football sector is experiencing significant changes and uncertainty mr murray said in a statement. the recent speculation surrounding malcolm glazer and manchester united has shown the unsettling effect possible where there are a number of disparate interests he added. i believe that this offer will strengthen the company and remove the potential for that type of uncertainty. sunderland were relegated from the premiership in but are currently pushing for promotion. the club managed to reduce its losses last year from £. to £. after selling a host of leading players. however the club s turnover dropped sharply from £. to £. over the same period because of a fall in broadcast revenues. bskyb bought its stake in sunderland in as part of a five year media partnership deal. the deal expired last month.
1334,clarke defends terror detentions the home secretary has defended his decision not to release foreign terror suspects despite a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws. house of lords law lords ruled against the detention measures last week. they said it was wrong to have one set of laws for foreign suspects and another for british suspects. new home secretary charles clarke said he would carefully consider the ruling and would return to parliament early in the new year with proposals. he insisted that he would not be rushed into judgement but would examine the law lords findings in detail. my duty is to look at first of all the security of this country and in so doing to consider very carefully the precise legal measures that there are. mr clarke s comments came in response to an emergency question from liberal democrat constitutional affairs spokesman david heath. mr heath said the judgement contained unprecedented condemnation and could not have been more unequivocal . he said he accepted the difficult balance between the nation s security and human rights but questioned why the home office had made no contingency plans for the present circumstances . these detainees should be prosecuted and tried. simply renewing the present deeply unsatisfactory legislation is not an option. shadow home secretary david davis said it was not possible to overstate the importance of the judgment and urged the government to move as fast as competently possible to sort the problem out in the interests of natural justice. if you do we will give you every support. the law lords ruling came on charles clarke s first day as home secretary last thursday following david blunkett s resignation. in a statement on the same day mr clarke said: i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year. in the meantime we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords. but the government was widely criticised for insisting the detentions would continue following the ruling last week. lord bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects but not britons. lord nicholls of birkenhead in his ruling said: indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law. the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the september attacks in the us.
1087,us interest rates increased to % us interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months in a widely anticipated move. the federal reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to % in light of mounting evidence that the us economy is regaining steam. us companies created twice as many jobs as expected in october while exports hit record levels in september. analysts said a clear-cut victory for president bush in last week s election paved the way for a rise. another rise could be in store for december some economists warned. the fed s open market committee - which sets interest rate policy in the us - voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise. the fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer with quarter percentage point rises in june august and september. the central bank has been acting to restrain inflationary pressures while being careful not to obstruct economic growth. the fed did not rule out raising rates once again in december but noted that any future increases would take place at a measured pace. in a statement the fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained well contained while the us economy appeared to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices . financial analysts broadly welcomed the fed s move and shares traded largely flat. the dow jones industrial average closed down . points or .% at .. recent evidence has pointed to an upturn in the us economy. us firms created jobs last month twice the amount expected while exports reached record levels in september. the economy grew .% in the third quarter slower than forecast but an improvement on the .% growth seen in the second quarter. analysts claimed the fed s assessment of future economic growth was a positive one but stressed that the jury was still out on the prospect of a further rise in december. let s wait until we see how growth and employment bear up under the fourth quarter s energy price drag before concluding that the fed has more work to do in said avery shenfeld senior economist at cibc world markets. i think the federal reserve does not want to rock the boat and is using a gradual approach in raising the interest rate said sung won sohn chief us economist for wells fargo bank. the economy is doing a bit better right now but there are still some concerns about geopolitics employment and the price of oil he added. the further rise in us rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on uk monetary policy. the bank of england (boe) has kept interest rates on hold at .% for the past three months leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked. in a report published on wednesday the bank said that with rates at their current level inflation would rise to its % target within two years. however boe governor mervyn king warned only last month that the era of consistently low inflation and low unemployment may be coming to an end.
2094,cyber crime booms in the last months have seen a dramatic growth in almost every security threat that plague windows pcs. the count of known viruses broke the barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than %. similarly phishing attempts in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data are recording growth rates of more than % and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers called bot nets used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes. one of the biggest changes of was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus said kevin hogan senior manager in symantec s security response group. although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code said mr hogan saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs. the financial incentives were driving criminal use of technology he said. his comment was echoed by graham cluley senior technology consultant from anti-virus firm sophos. mr cluley said: when the commercial world gets involved things really get nasty. virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum. in particular phishing attacks which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers boomed during . web portal lycos europe reported a % increase in the number of phishing e-mail messages it was catching. the anti-phishing working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of % or more per month. those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity. this change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages. they are not an efficient way of spreading viruses said mr hogan. they are very noisy and they are not technically challenging. the opening months of did see the appearance of the netsky bagle and mydoom mass mailers but since then more surreptitious viruses or worms have dominated. mr hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting pcs to take part in bot nets that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites. in september symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active bot computers rose from to per day. thanks to these bot nets spam continued to be a problem in . anti-spam firms report that in many cases legitimate e-mail has shrunk to less than % of messages. part of the reason that these bot nets have become so prevalent he said was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created. in the past many viruses such as netsky have been the work of an individual or group. by contrast said mr hogan the code for viruses such as gaobot spybot and randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time. the result is that now there are more than variations of the spybot worm. that s unprecedented said mr hogan. what makes it difficult is that they are all co-existing with each other and do not exist in an easy to understand chronology. the emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in . in the past threats to smart phones have been largely theoretical because the viruses created to cripple phones existed only in the laboratory rather than the wild. in june the cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using bluetooth short-range radio technology. also released this year was the mosquito game for symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers and in november the skulls trojan came to light which can cripple phones. on the positive side finnish security firm f-secure said that was the best-ever year for the capture arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers. in total eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called virus writing group were sentenced. one high-profile arrest was that of german teenager sven jaschen who confessed to be behind the netsky and sasser virus families. also shut down were the carderplanet and shadowcrew websites that were used to trade stolen credit card numbers.

1628,malik rejects all-black mp lists a call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and asian mps has been rejected by one of labour s most senior asians. shahid malik who is on labour s ruling nec accepted people s frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. just of britain s mps are from ethnic minority groups he added. commission for racial equality chief trevor phillips argued on sunday the time had come for such shortlists. that came after it emerged that one of britain s most ethnically diverse constituency west ham was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an nec ruling. mr phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. for example in west ham this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. if we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented we have to say that after or years of talking about this we cannot go on the same way he said. he added: it would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [west ham] in the whole of europe we didn t have a minority candidate. appearing on bbc radio s today programme mr malik who is himself running for the seat of dewsbury acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates. but he argued: i do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren t doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective. labour mp diane abbot who backs mr phillips proposal of shortlists said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority mps - keith vaz paul boateng and bernie grant - in but it took another years before another black woman was able to win a seat. that was a rate of progress ms abbott described as painful . i am a little older than shahid and served on the national executive committee in the - i was the first black person on the nec ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and asian mp hasn t worked she said. the shortlist strategy works for women and i believe that it can be made to work for black and asian people. on tuesday labour chairman ian mccartney said his party was ambitious to improve black and asian representation. we haven t ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this he said.
1950,pompeii gets digital make-over the old-fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer-generated images that bring the site to life. a european union-funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer-augmented versions of archaeological attractions. it would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as pompeii. it could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism. the technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site. the lifeplus project is part of the eu s information society technologies initiative aimed at promoting user-friendly technology and enhancing european cultural heritage. engineers and researchers working in the europe-wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented-reality system. it would require the visitor to wear a head-mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer. the camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor s viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements. at pompeii for example the visitor would not just see the frescos taverns and villas that have been excavated but also people going about their daily life. augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as troy and lord of the rings and in computer gaming. this technology can now be used for much more than just computer games said professor nadia magnenat-thalman of the swiss research group miralab. we are for the first time able to run this combination of software processes to create walking talking people with believable clothing skin and hair in real-time she said. unlike virtual reality which delivers an entirely computer-generated scene to the viewer the lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views. crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor s view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements. the software capable of doing this has been developed by a uk company . andrew stoddart chief scientist at said that the eu project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life. the popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computer-generated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life he said.
2132,what s next for next-gen consoles the next generation of video games consoles are in development but what will the new machines mean for games firms and consumers we may not know when they will be released what they will be called or even what they will be able to do but one thing is certain - they are coming. sony microsoft and nintendo are all expected to release new machines in the next months. the details of playstation xbox (codename xenon) and nintendo s so-called revolution are still to be finalised but developers are having to work on titles for the new machines regardless. we know maybe what the will do but we can only guess said rory armes studio general manager for video game giant electronic arts in europe. it s a horrendous effort in the first year he admitted. microsoft had delivered development kits to ea said mr armes but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo to send kits. although the details may not be nailed down mr armes said ea was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines. the rumours are that playstation will have a little more under the hood [than xbox ] he said. microsoft is obviously a software company first and foremost while sony has more experience in hardware. i think sony will be able to push more into a box at cost. what is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power. it is also likely that they will contain convergence technologies to make the machines more of an entertainment hub. at the consumer electronics show in las vegas microsoft boss bill gates said xbox would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle. while short on detail he painted a picture of a machine that would complement a pc and offer great video gaming but video gaming for a broader set of people more communications more media more connectivity . sony is thought to have a similar vision for while nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games. until it is clear precisely what the new machines can do developers are working on a first round of titles to harness the new horsepower. gary dunn development director at codemasters said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles. we are working on new libraries of effects. a lot of the major techniques are already out there and in use in pc gaming such as pixel shaders and normal mapping. mr dunn said he expected the introduction of real-world physics to be a major part of the new consoles. we want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game. in the first year at least developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines. graphical spit and polish and better physics in line with the capabilities of current high-end graphics cards for pcs should be expected. simon gardner president of climax s action studio said: it s definitely an exciting time. we want to give more freedom to the player. we want to give players an emotional connection to the characters they play. the environments will be much more believable and dramatic growing and changing as you play. there will be a breadth of effects more involving worlds to play in. it s a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush. we re being given more tools. for the average consumer we can get things of a more filmic quality. gerhard florin head of ea in europe said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games. many will be sceptical - gamers were given similar predictions during the last transition of console hardware - but this time it would seem to be more likely. will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies said mr florin. he said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles. a gamer could buy a starter disc for euros. when he goes home he goes online and he could buy ai and levels as you go. it s much smarter if you can get levels as you go. mr armes warned that developers still had to learn how to tell stories effectively in the medium. in some ways we are trying to forget about the hardware go in the opposite direction. we have been very bad at letting technology design our creativity. what we have to do as a company is start ignoring the technology and learning our craft in telling stories. mr gardner agreed: we can thrown more polygons around and have better ai but if it doesn t make for a better game then that s not very useful. developers will certainly have the tools with the new machines but how they employ them is still to be decided.
1497,lib dems unveil election slogan the liberal democrats will present themselves as the real alternative in the forthcoming general election campaign charles kennedy has said. unveiling the slogan at the party s spring conference he said there was no glass ceiling to its ambitions. he told delegates that labour had abused the public s trust and that the tories had failed to oppose them. in response the conservatives insisted that theirs was the party that understood the forgotten majority . speaking in harrogate mr kennedy said: people want a credible principled political party which offers a different vision of what britain can be. only the liberal democrats stood against the iraq war he said and they had also provided strong opposition to the government s plans on id cards anti-terror measures and taxation. he said: if you voted conservative in ... what good did it do you your vote was wasted. what people needed was ... a party which was listening to their concerns; a party which was prepared to stand up and say so; a party which said no to the prime minister. responding to the claims tory party co-chairman liam fox said: like labour the lib dems are soft on crime support higher taxes oppose controlled immigration and support giving europe more control over our lives. mr kennedy also outlined his party s plan to impose a % income tax rate on earnings over £ a year. the money would be used to help pay for key policies such as abolishing university tuition fees scrapping council tax in favour of local income tax and providing free care for the elderly he said. labour and the tories claim the sums do not add up and that working families would be hardest hit. mr kennedy said: britain is the fourth-largest economy in the world. we have world class businesses and a world class workforce. so why are two million of our pensioners living below the poverty line all the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in may although prime minister tony blair has not confirmed any timing. earlier mr kennedy told radio s today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with labour in the event of a hung parliament. we go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party he said. mr kennedy has been under fire in recent days for missing monday s commons vote on the government s controversial anti-terrorism laws along with other lib dem mps. on saturday the lib dem chief executive said it was just a cock-up that mr kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote which the government won by a majority of only . nobody had any idea that was going to happen lord rennard told reporters at the party conference. he said he was certain mps would get another chance to vote against the plans.
1666,games help you learn and play god games in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational says research. a us researcher has suggested that games such as the sims could be a good way to teach languages. ravi purushotma believes that the world of the sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods. the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore said mr purushotma. there must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework. but instead of fearing computer games ravi purushotma believes that educationalists particularly language teachers should embrace games. one goal would be to break what i believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional he said. he believes that the phenomenal ability of games such as the sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation. the hard part of learning any language said mr purushotma were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences. boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be. the way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity he said. by contrast said mr purushotma learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all. this was because the sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players. instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on. the incidental information about what a sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning said mr purushotma. by contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context. for instance he said in a version of the sims adapted to teach german if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word energie the actions of a tired sim stumbling then falling asleep would illustrate the meaning. if necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players or students understanding. one of the drawbacks of the sims said mr purushotma was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation. however online versions of the sims in which people have to move in meet the neighbours and get to know the local town could be adapted to help this. although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn mr purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help. getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid he believes. before now he said educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games. but he said using pre-prepared game worlds such as the sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game. this could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons. i m hoping now to re-create a well-polished german learning mod for the sequel by this summer he told the bbc news website. i m encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with japanese and spanish. earlier work with a colleague on using civilisation iii to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society s problems can not always come from making a single change. a report on the experiment said: students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play using geography and history as tools for their game and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play. mr purushotma s ideas were aired in an article for the journal language learning and technology.
660,uk needs tax cuts tories insist a major change of direction is needed in britain if it is to prosper the shadow chancellor said as the tory party spring conference began. oliver letwin said the uk could not compete with other countries without the £ tax cuts he was promising. tory co-chairman liam fox had opened the forum in brighton with an attack on labour s record and party leader michael howard is due to speak later. tony blair has said conservative policies would cause economic failure. but mr letwin said britain had fallen from fourth to in the international economic competitiveness league. can this country compete can this country prosper unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy he said. if we are going to take on the great challenges the challenges like those posed by the chinese and the indians we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax he said. the fact is the very carefully costed fully funded plans we have laid out for saving £ by - are absolutely crucial to delivering an economy that will prosper and provide people with jobs and indeed provide the public services with the money they need on a sustainable long-term basis. mr letwin said voting for labour meant choosing higher taxes borrowing and waste. earlier dr fox had said labour s rule had been characterised by lost trust and failure to deliver . he also attacked the government s failure to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. a tory government would sort out the shambles of immigration put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools he said. michael howard who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday will address them in a lunchtime speech. his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the party s opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament. the bill was finally passed on friday evening after more than hours of debate. mr howard is likely to defend his party s handling of the bill which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blair s promise that mps would be able to review it within a year.
94,amnesty chief laments war failure the lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups amnesty international s chief has said. in a lecture at the london school of economics irene khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since september . she said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message. and it had to fight poverty not just focus on political rights for elites. ms khan highlighted detentions without trial including those at the us camp at guantanamo bay in cuba and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems. what s a new challenge is the way in which this age-old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war she said. by using the language of war human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war. ms khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major country in the world. the human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights she said. that was accompanied by a crisis of governance where the united nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account. the amnesty secretary-general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism. public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups she said. ms khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system. there needed to be a drive to use simpler language talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes. such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world she said. the human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments. al-qaeda for example was not going to be impressed by a traditional amnesty letter writing campaign. more also needed to be done to develop a human rights framework for international business corporations. amnesty international members voted in to extend the organisation s work from political and civil rights to cover social and economic rights too. ms khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife. we would be an elitist bunch working for the elites for those who cannot read the newspaper of their choice rather than those who cannot read she said. despite her concerns ms khan dubbed herself a hope-monger saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges.
453,preview: ireland v england (sun) lansdowne road dublin sunday february gmt radio lw and this website ireland are going for their first grand slam since after two opening wins and england represent their sternest test of the championship so far. england were sloppy and leaderless in the defeats against wales and france and another loss would be unthinkable. the pressure is on coach andy robinson and his side have to deliver. despite england s dramatic dip in form since the world cup final - they have lost eight of their last matches - ireland coach eddie o sullivan says his side should not underestimate the visitors. had they kicked their points they would have beaten france and that would have created a different landscape for sunday he said. this is england we are talking about. they have a depth of talent and a very good record against ireland. they will target a victory in dublin as the turning point in their six nations. the differences between the sides is also highlighted in the team selections for the dublin encounter. ireland despite having gordon d arcy still out injured have been boosted by the return of star skipper brian o driscoll who missed the scotland game with a hamstring injury. the knowledge that the england game was coming up really helped during rehabilitation he said. the will to play in this game was enormous. it doesn t get much bigger than england at home. as well as entering the tournament without players like jonny wilkinson mike tindall and richard hill england have now lost two tighthead props in julian white and phil vickery while blind-side flanker lewis moody is a major concern. robinson who received a lot of flak for the inclusion and then dropping of centre mathew tait has kept faith with kicking fly-half charlie hodgson despite his horror show at twickenham. if england slump in dublin it will be their worst run of results in the championship since . but robinson was bullish during the week about the game saying that his side are going there to get in their faces and has identified the line-out and tackle area as the key to england s chances. and despite the recent results skipper jason robinson believes there is nothing wrong with the mood in the camp. there is no lack of confidence in the team said the sale full-back. we have had a good week s training and we are all looking forward to the challenge. i still believe in this team. i know if we get our game right we will win the games. g murphy; g dempsey b o driscoll s horgan d hickie; r o gara p stringer; r corrigan s byrne j hayes; m o kelly p o connell; s easterby j o connor a foley. f sheahan m horan d o callaghan e miller g easterby d humphreys k maggs. j robinson (capt); m cueto j noon o barkley j lewsey; c hodgson h ellis; g rowntree s thompson m stevens; d grewcock b kay; j worsley l moody m corry. a titterrell d bell s borthwick a hazell m dawson a goode o smith.

1586,apple ipod family expands market apple has expanded its ipod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players. its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an ipod mini model which can hold compared to a previous . the company which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. a version has also been added to the ipod photo family. the latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of £. the original ipod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design. during about million portable players were sold million of which were apple ipods. but analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the itunes online store which has given the company a % share of the legal download music market. mike mcguire a research director at analyst gartner told the bbc news website that apple had done a good job in sealing off the market from competition so far. they have created a very seamless package which i think is the idea of the product - the design function and the software are very impressive he said. he added that the threat from others was always present however. creative other microsoft-partnered devices real sony and so on are ratcheting up the marketing message and advertising he said. creative was very upbeat about how many of its creative zen players it had shipped by the end of last year he said. its second-generation models like the creative zen micro photo is due out in the summer. it will have of memory on board. digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young americans according to recent research by the pew internet and american life project. one in us adults - million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort. sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in according to the record industry with million tracks bought online in the us and europe in months. the ifpi industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players. people are also starting to use them in novel ways. some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute diy radio shows called podcasts. but will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets. according to mr mcguire research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music which they can do with high-capacity storage devices like ipods and creative zens. mobiles do not yet have this capacity though and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music. mr mcguire said apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with motorola to produce a version of itunes for motorola phones.
2029,friends fear with lost mobiles people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends. more than % of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years. more than half (%) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm intervoice said that they do not have another address book. a fifth rely entirely on mobiles. about % of uk adults own at least one mobile according to official figures. it is estimated that % of over own a mobile according to intervoice but the figures are higher for those aged between and . most to -year-olds (%) and to -year-olds (%) own at least one. nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts information again if the phone was lost stolen or replaced. the survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book. many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details and with people changing their phones once a year on average it becomes a problem. they also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart relying on the mobile phone book instead. we re a nation of lazy so-and-sos david noone from intervoice said. we put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can t be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book. the mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart. one in three women the survey said thought if they lost their phones it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether. most (%) said they had no idea what their partner s number was. mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves. generally information from sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software. sim back-up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds. but some operators offer customers free web-based back-up services too. orange told the bbc news website that those with orange smartphones could use the my phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online. for non-smartphone users a memory mate card could be used to back up data on the phone. also offers a free web-based syncing service which works over gprs and gsm. neither vodafone or t-mobile currently offer a free network service for back-ups but encourage people to use sim back-up devices. it is thought that about phones are lost or stolen every month and % of total street crime involves a mobile. mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year. globally more than million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of % more than the previous year according to analysts. it is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of .
1275,could yukos be a blessing in disguise other things being equal the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business. but in the looking-glass world of modern russia the opposite might just be true a new report* has argued. the study from the centre for economic policy research does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos. but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms even targets of the tax police. an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive even accounting for increased levels of taxation the authors say. the paper s reasoning is complex and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular the propensity of management to steal from the company. the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. in the west meanwhile higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. on the other hand increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. the net result the authors say is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness. after vladimir putin became president in he did not raise taxes but put a lot of effort - too much critics argue - into enforcement. since then the russian stock market has more than trebled in value a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. the report highlights the case of sibneft a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year. after mr putin came to power the company s overall effective tax rate rose from .% to .% and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. but shareholders benefited hugely: sibneft started to pay dividends - $ in and almost $ in - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. according to the authors although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers. does this analysis make sense in part certainly. for all its faults corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since . companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. foreign direct investment long negligible is starting to flow in serious amounts - $ in - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe. but the authors model does not quite cover all the complexities. for a start the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit governments want to maximise tax revenue. in fact the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. companies can for example persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes. and the authors definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western. genuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. the case against yukos for example has moved in fits and starts with little clarity from the government about its intentions and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. as far as most commentators are concerned the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. since yukos founder mikhail khodorkovsky was arrested a year ago the russian market has dropped by % - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.
871,dvd review: spider-man it s a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good. but spider-man breaks that rule in two. it s not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of spidey versus doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker. gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning. a few effects look false but tobey maguire kirsten dunst and alfred molina make this compelling. the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects. this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film. then there are commentaries trailers and a blooper reel. sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man. now is that a christmas present or what give this to someone on december and you won t see them again until early in the new year. it s not truly a complete collection and leans more toward wayne s earlier films: there s no true grit for instance though there is hellraisers. the films look well transferred to dvd though none has extras. it was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous series became a cult favourite that s been long awaited on dvd. this set has the first season of buck (gil gerard) and wilma s (erin gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it s all as camp and gaudy as you remember. but it s also a disappointment. the us dvd has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. the bigger omission though is that there are no extras. that s particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them.
278,soaring oil hits world economy the soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth although world s major economies should weather the storm of price rises according to the oecd. in its latest bi-annual report the oecd cut its growth predictions for the world s main industrialised regions. us growth would reach .% in but fall to .% next year from a previous estimate of .% the oecd said. however the paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum. forecasts for japanese growth were also scaled back to .% from .% this year and .% from .% in . but the outlook was worst for the -member eurozone bloc with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to .% from .% this year and .% from .% in the oecd said. overall the report forecast total growth of .% in for the member countries of the oecd slipping to .% next year before recovering to .% in . there are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future said jean-philippe cotis the oecd s chief economist. the price of crude is about % higher than it was at the start of but down on the record high of $. set in late october. a dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending the oecd said. the oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. if the oil price does not rise any further then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters vincent koen a senior economist with the oecd told the bbc s world business report. the recovery that was underway and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year would then regain momentum in the course of . china s booming economy and a spectacular comeback in japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery the oecd said. supported by strong balance sheets and high profits the recovery of business investment should continue in north america and start in earnest in europe it added. however the report warned: it remains to be seen whether continental europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand. the oecd highlighted current depressed household expenditure in germany and the eurozone s over-reliance on export-led growth.
755,us to rule on yukos refuge call yukos has said a us bankruptcy court will decide whether to block russia s impending auction of its main production arm on thursday. the russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us in an attempt to halt the forced sale. however judge letitia clark said the hearing would continue on thursday when arguments in the case would be heard. russian authorities are due to auction off yuganskneftegas on december to pay a huge tax bill sent to yukos. russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm s most lucrative asset yuganskneftegas to help pay a $ (£) back tax bill which they claim is owed by yukos. filing for bankruptcy protection in the us was a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders employees and customers said yukos chief executive steven theede. the company added it had opted to take action through american courts as us bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor company s property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders investments. however as the firm is based in russia and has no significant us assets lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case. we are here to stop % of our body from being cut off on sunday zack clement a lawyer for yukos told judge clark in an emergency hearing in houston texas on wednesday. as well as the bid to get chapter bankruptcy - which protects firms from creditors allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances - the group also made a claim for damages against the russian government. yukos asked the houston court to order russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a campaign of illegal discriminatory and disproportionate tax claims. mr clement said that under russian law the russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law. he added that the opening bid for the firm s yuganskneftgas unit was $ - less than half of the $ that yukos advisers say it is worth. we believe the only significant bidder at the auction on sunday is gazprom he said referring to russia s natural gas giant. yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm. many commentators believe the russian government s aggressive pursuit of yukos is a politically-motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky who had funded liberal opposition groups was arrested in october last year on fraud and tax evasion charges and is still in jail analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off it is likely to be bought up by a government-backed firm like gazprom effectively bringing a large chunk of russia s lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control.
1453,broadband set to revolutionise tv bt is starting its push into television with plans to offer tv over broadband. as a telecoms company bt is moving to a content distribution strategy andrew burke chief of bt s new entertainment unit told the iptv world forum. we want to be an entertainment facilitator he said on the opening day of the london conference. the bbc is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to non-licence fee payers overseas. the corporation s interactive media player (imp) is its first foray into broadband tv - known as iptv (internet protocol tv). we see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers said bt s andrew burke. with more people on broadband and connection speeds increasing telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it. increased competition between net service providers encouraged by ofcom has eroded bt s position in the market. it is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over adsl a reality. it also sees delivering tv over broadband as a way of getting high-definition (hd) content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional regular broadcasts. the bbc s imp has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in . before it officially launches the bbc must show the government how it offers value for money. delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value says the bbc because it gives people more control and more choice. iptv is a similar idea to voip services like skype. both use broadband net connections to carry information like video and voice in packets of data instead of conventional means. since it uses internet technology iptv could mean more choice of programmes more more interactivity tailored programming and more localised content outside of conventional satellite digital cable and terrestrial broadcasts. it is all part of the larger changing tv technology landscape and like personal digital video recorders (pvrs) gives people much more control over tv. broadcasters see iptv and pvrs as both as a threat and an opportunity. the bbc recognises that tv over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it said rahul chakkara controller of bbci s / interactive tv services. the imp is based on peer-to-peer technology and lets people download programmes the bbc owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast. iptv enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times said mr chakkara. so we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for [via the licence fee] they can access it any time they want. it helps said mr burke that people are more au fait with terms like digital interactive now that digital tv reaches more than % of uk homes. according to benoit joly from broadband telecoms firm thales % of europe cannot get satellite tv or digital tv. they could get iptv though. analysts say that iptv will account for % of the digital tv market in europe alone by the end of the decade. what needs to happen now agree analysts is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service; connections would be ideal. bt does not see itself as a broadcaster of iptv services rather as an enabler said mr burke. its strategy is a hybrid approach he explained where over-the-air conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband. initially appealing to niche markets like sports fans it will widen out. but iptv could be used for home-monitoring pet cams localised news services and local authority tv too says bt. it even suggests that it could target those households in the uk that do not own a computer % of the country. broadband to them would not be about data and the net - that could come later for them - but about cheap phone calls and more choice of tv programmes. home choice already offers hours of shows and channels delivered over broadband to homes in london. with a broadband net subscription you can also get your tv and phone service. through content deals and partnerships it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues. it aims to expand nationally but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its subscribers now and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer. although still at a very early stage iptv is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network - another utility like electricity.
2071,lesotho textile workers lose jobs six foreign-owned textile factories have closed in lesotho leaving garment workers jobless union officers told the ap news agency. factory workers union secretary general billy macaefa blamed the closures on the end of worldwide textile quotas. the quotas for developing nations ended on january gave them a set share of the rich countries markets. they also limited the amount countries like china could export to the big markets of the united states and eu. we understand that some (owners)... were complaining that the south african rand was strong against the us dollar and they were losing when exporting textiles and clothing to the united states mr macaefa said at a news briefing in the capital maseru. lesotho s currency the maloti is fixed to the rand. but we suspect that they left the country unceremoniously because of the end of quotas introduced by the world trade organization. he said the six factories were leisure garments modern garments precious six garments tw garments lesotho hats and vogue landmark. the owners - two from taiwan two from china one from mauritius and one from malaysia - left over the december holiday period without informing or paying their employees he said. union leaders and trade campaigners have been warning that developing nations such as lesotho sri lanka and bangaldesh could lose thousands of jobs once the quotas were lifted. in the mountainous country surrounded by south africa it is feared as many as textile workers could lose their jobs and mr mafeca said he expected more companies to leave. the assistance of a us law had given lesotho s textiles duty-free access to north american markets. the african growth and opportunity act (agoa) gave sub-saharan countries preferential access to the us market for apparel and textile products as well as a wide range of other goods. a lesotho government news briefing is expected on wednesday.
1714,ultra fast wi-fi nears completion ultra high speed wi-fi connections moved closer to reality on thursday when intel said it would list standards for the technology later this year. intel is developing ultra-wideband technology (uwb) which would allow fast data transfer but with low power needs. uwb is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless usb devices which need low power consumption. a rival uwb standard is being developed by motorola and chip firm freescale. at the mobile phone conference in cannes last month samsung demonstrated a phone using uwb technology from freescale. at a press conference on thursday intel announced that two uwb groups wimedia alliance and multi-band ofdm alliance had merged to support the technology. uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home. the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second. consumer electronics companies want uwb to replace cables and simplify set-up jeff ravencraft technology strategist at intel and chairman of the wireless usb promoter group told technology site zdnet. thirty percent of consumer electronics returns are because the consumer couldn t set up the equipment. the first products using uwb technology from intel are due to hit the market later this year. initially they will be products using wireless usb . connections. uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let a person s gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. the technology works over a range up to metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. intel says the benefit of uwb is that it does not interfere with other wi-fi technologies already in use such as wi-fi wimax and mobile phone networks.

255,mps criticise child access system divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system mps have said. the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. courts should be used as a last resort but where they are their orders should be enforced more rigorously mps said. but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access. currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount. an arbitrary template imposed on all families whatever the needs of the child would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position the mps said. they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases. this would reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety they said. delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed a new status quo arrangement for the children to become established by default they said. although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present. given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents. committee chairman alan beith said the five-month inquiry had been a complex and emotive one. at the moment far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation he said. this situation has to change. the court system should only be used as a last resort where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with. this will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country.

542,act on detention ruling uk urged the government must act quickly on the law lords ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful mary robinson has said. the former un commissioner for human rights and irish president told radio s today the government s response would be scrutinised internationally. it would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it she said. home secretary charles clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present. speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation mr clarke said: i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year. in the meantime we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords. mrs robinson said the law lords ruling was in line with international legal opinion and praised their very decisive eight to one majority. what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government but say that there had been a disproportionate use that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn t apply to british citizens she said. mrs robinson warned that a lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg. if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords. she said a meeting of the club of madrid - a group of former world leaders - to be held in the spanish capital on the march anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications. i have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles but also the response of the british government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there. the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. the law lords said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status . the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.
671,: an irish athletics year won t be remembered as one of irish athletics great years. the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably seems to herald an upcoming olympiad. but come late august a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics - or to be more accurate the lack of it. sonia o sullivan s olympic farewell apart there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers. but after the disastrous build-up to the games we shouldn t have been surprised. at the start of the year an o sullivan had been earmarked as ireland s best medal prospect but as it turned out walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. less than a week before the olympics the sport was rocked by news that hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo. lombard s shattering of mark carroll s national record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation. the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport. back at pre-olympic ranch in greece it must have seemed that things couldn t have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens. once the track and field action began in athens a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair cragg s performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the final did offer hope for the future. our beloved sonia scraped into the women s final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. as it happened she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar. it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the hours before the final although typically the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. amazingly she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the flora lite road race in london and while her major championship days may be over it s unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. at least sonia managed to make it to athens. at the start of the year several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august an out-of-form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem and a bad lane draw meant a time of . and an early exit. james mcilroy gareth turnbull zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens. hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. the injury-plagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the qualifying mark but : was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter. a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckee s athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in . pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came. as the summer ended stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. donnelly and his annadale striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on december. a large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andy s many friends. as only death can it put the year s athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.

495,thousands join strike in wales thousands of civil servants were on strike across wales on friday in protest at planned job cuts. a range of services in wales were affected as civil servants in wales joined the uk-wide strike. the strike called by the public and commercial services union was the biggest by civil servants in a decade. the action follows chancellor gordon brown s announcement in july that jobs would be cut with around of those expected in wales. the worst-affected area in wales will be the department of work and pensions where jobs are threatened. across wales pickets were held by striking civil servants with protests in towns and cities including cardiff bangor aberystwyth and wrexham. gordon brown issued a defiant statement about the strike saying the action would not affect the government s determination to make savings in order to increase investment in healthcare education transport and the fight against crime. our decisions mean more police more teachers more doctors and more nurses he said. we will provide help with information relocation and retraining to help staff move into frontline work within the public sector but we will not be diverted from these necessary changes so that we can make this essential investment. the uk-wide action hit jobcentres benefit agencies pensions offices and driving test centres. the strike also affected the welsh assembly building in cardiff bay where only pass-holders were allowed in. pickets were in place across wales with protests around the country. pcs union spokesman jeff evans said: in wales the civil service is major employer there are more civil servants employed in wales proportionately than in any other part of the country. our protest is about defending jobs and also local services across the country. parts of objective one areas and welsh-speaking areas will be particularly affected by these cuts. the chancellor has said that the cuts will allow funding for more teachers and police. piers freelove is senior benefit officer on the picket line at companies house in cardiff. he said: the majority of people have decided not to come in because of the threat to their jobs. i joined the civil service to provide services as well as get a decent pension as we thought and pay and it s those services that are being threatened as well as our jobs. people like pensioners need a face-to-face service not an impersonal service on the phone which is what they want to impose. pcsu deputy general secretary hugh lanning who was on the same picket line said: we re asking for them to negotiate not just to make announcements. there s a sensible way to do things and at the moment they re not even talking about how to go about it sensibly. the ballot was for one day s action. no further action is anticipated without a further ballot of staff. the welsh assembly government said: this is a strike about national civil service issues. it is not about specific issues local to wales or the assembly.
782,bollywood draws global stars british actress antonia bernath is making her debut in kisna - the warrior poet marking a growing trend for non-indian stars to appear in bollywood films. directed by bollywood veteran subhash ghai the film is set in the british raj and bernath plays an army general s daughter who falls in love with a rural boy kisna. i liked the fluid nature of film-making. we improvised quite a lot says bernath. at times it felt very chaotic but mr ghai was quite clear about what he wanted. picked from more than girls in an audition in london bernath cut short her education at bristol s old vic theatre school to take up the opportunity. it is not often that somebody gets to play the lead role straight out of a drama school. she spent three weeks learning hindi and taking dance lessons. initially i was a bit sceptical about how people would respond to me bernath says. but i found the hindi film industry very warm and encouraging. i even had a few offers before the work on kisna was completed. films are one of india s biggest exports and those like lagaan and monsoon wedding have broken the traditional boundaries of colour and culture. spurred by this bollywood producers are trying to go global in all aspects of film-making be it technical or artistic. from young heart-throbs like nick moran of lock stock and two smoking barrels to model sophie dahl many non-indian stars want to make the most of this opportunity. bollywood has truly gone global says taran adarsh editor of indian film journal trade guide. directors are now attempting to woo non-asian audience to increase their share in the overseas film market. kisna has been shot simultaneously in hindi and english with the english print shortened by an hour to accommodate the western audience. the film even has a song composed in english by ar rahman the director of the popular west end musical bombay dreams. identification is a popular cinematic device. use of european or american actors can be viewed as a step in that direction says adarsh. the cast of kisna also includes british actors michael maloney caroline langrishe and polly adams. another actress annabelle wallace plays the lead role in a bilingual romantic comedy dil jo bhi kahey (whatever the heart says) which also stars indian screen legend amitabh bachchan. actor and producer aamir khan s forthcoming venture the rising is set against the backdrop of the indian mutiny of with british actor toby stephens in a key role. but it isn t only the western actors looking eastwards. bollywood sweetheart aishwarya rai recently seen in bride and prejudice alongside new zealand actor martin henderson is building her international career. and many other bollywood stars have their eyes set on hollywood. hollywood or bollywood it s the box office that determines whether something is a passing phase or a trend says adarsh. kisna - the warrior poet opens in the uk on january.
416,microsoft releases patches microsoft has warned pc users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in windows programs. in its monthly security bulletin it flagged up eight critical security holes which could leave pcs open to attack if left unpatched. the number of holes considered critical is more than usual. they affect windows programs including internet explorer (ie) media player and instant messaging. four other important fixes were also released. these were considered to be less critical however. if not updated either automatically or manually pc users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely install programs change and delete or see data. one of the critical patches microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some ie flaws. stephen toulouse a microsoft security manager said the flaws were known about and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw he did not rule them out. often when a critical flaw is announced spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. a further patch fixes a hole in media player windows messenger and msn messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. the most important ones are those which are classed as critical . its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker sybari software as part of microsoft s plans to make its own security programs.
419,celtic unhappy over bulgaria date martin o neill hopes to block stilian petrov s call-up by bulgaria during celtic s busy festive programme. the celtic manager does not view the friendly against valenciana - a region of spain - on december as important. i can t say i was overly pleased at the fixture being played just after christmas said o neill. we will have to speak with the bulgarian fa. it s their prerogative for them to arrange a fixture and our prerogative how we handle it. bulgaria s game comes between celtic s boxing day meeting with hearts and their january fixture against livingston. o neill believes the extra game will not help a midfielder whose season has already been affected by injury. they have organised a game at a rather awkward time he added. when we were out playing barcelona i spoke with the bulgarian manager hristo stoichkov and he mentioned this game to me. we pay his wages we are the ones that if an awkward fixture is going to be played at some stage or another it should be to our benefit rather than anyone else. i have said this before but bulgaria are the one nation who seem to organise a lot of friendly games.
1831,agassi fear for melbourne andre agassi s involvement in the australian open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the kooyong classic with a hip injury. agassi was serving at - down in the first set to fellow american andy roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match. my hip was cramping and i just could not continue said the -year-old. agassi who has won the australian open four times will have an mri scan to discover the extent of the damage. he said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss wimbledon last year. the good news is that it didn t just tear it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself which is hopefully more of the issue he added. that wasn t comfortable out there at all what i was feeling. i have to wait and see what i m dealing with - it s a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesn t feel right and is getting worse. it s very disappointing and i ll have to do my best to deal with it. time will shortly tell if it (the australian open) is a possibility or not. i was not counting on this being the end of the day for me. maybe in a few days i ll have a much better sense of what my hopes will be.

172,australia rates at four year high australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country s economy. the reserve bank of australia lifted interest rates .% to .% their first upwards move in more than a year. however shortly after the bank made its decision new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. the bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts. the rate hike was the first since december and had been well-flagged in advance. however opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the australian economy grew just .% between october and december and .% on an annual basis. the figures representing a decline from the .% growth in gdp seen between july and september were below market expectations. consumer spending remains strong however and the bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures. over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited said ian macfarlane governor of the reserve bank. at .% inflation remains within the bank s -% target range. however exports declined in the second half of fuelling a rise in the country s current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record australian dollar .. the australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near year low. the economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn t look to me like it s slowing in any unreasonable way said treasurer peter costello. stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy. that .% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in - said michael blythe chief economist at the commonwealth bank of australia. this suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of .
166,springer criticises opera musical talk show host jerry springer whose programme inspired the controversial opera shown by the bbc has said he would not have written it himself. the bbc received complaints before the musical was broadcast and protesters demonstrated outside bbc buildings across the uk. springer helped launch the west end show and attended the opening night. i wouldn t have written it. i don t believe in making fun of other religions he said. the tv host said he understood how people could have thought the musical had gone too far. you know on our tv show if people use inappropriate language we bleep it out if there s nudity we cover it up so that viewers at home don t get to see any of this he said. asked whether he thought the bbc should have screened the controversial musical he said: i don t know if they should have had it on television but good lord if you don t like what s on television that s why god gave us remote controls. my show is about dysfunctional people and i defy anyone to watch the show and suggest to me the people on it aren t to some degree dysfunctional. if i did a show about the war in iraq it wouldn t make me a warmonger i would just be doing my job to report on the war. in the case of my show it s my job to report on the dysfunctions that take place in society. the british-born presenter is in london to speak at a fundraising dinner for the united jewish israel appeal. the dinner on tuesday is expected to be attended by more than guests.
92,goldsmith: i was not leant on the attorney general has again denied being leant on by downing street to make the legal case for invading iraq. claims a written answer on the legality of the war was drafted by downing street were wholly unfounded he insisted during stormy lords exchanges. lord goldsmith said the answer represented his genuinely held independent view the war was legal. the text was released on the eve of a crucial commons vote in which mps backed the invasion of iraq. many labour mps have since indicated that the attorney general s answer played a pivotal role in their willingness to back the conflict. the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice saying such papers are always kept confidential. in the house of lords the attorney general faced a call by former tory lord chancellor lord mackay to now publish the full text of the advice - the suggestion was rejected. another peer meanwhile lord skidelsky said not to publish the full legal opinion would strengthen the suspicion that the the original text was doctored for public consumption in exactly the same way as the notorious intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction . last week lord goldsmith said in a statement: i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised and of course approved the answer. he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman two of his own officials three foreign office officials a qc christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor lord irvine of lairg. no other minister or official was involved in any way. as i have always made clear i set out in the answer my own genuinely held independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (un) security council resolutions he said. the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government. former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith s admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled. the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary but others certainly did he said. what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full accurate summary of his formal opinion. tony blair has dismissed questions about the attorney general s advice and said his parliamentary statement had been a fair summary of his opinion. that s what he [lord goldsmith] said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue. on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential tory mp michael mates who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry told the bbc: that as a general rule is right but it s not an absolute rule. he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention he said. mr mates added: this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister. a book published by philippe sands qc a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on march that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action. a short statement about lord goldsmith s position presented in a written parliamentary answer on march - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this.
1234,verizon seals takeover of mci verizon has won a takeover battle for us phone firm mci with a bid worth $. (£.) reports say. the two firms are expected to seal the deal on monday morning according to news agency reports despite what was thought to be a higher bid from qwest. the us telecoms market is consolidating fast with former long-distance giant at&t being bought by former subsidiary sbc earlier this year for $. mci exited bankruptcy in april having gone bust under previous name worldcom. the bankruptcy followed its admission in that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. shareholders lost about $ when the company collapsed while workers lost their jobs. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial accused of overseeing an $ fraud. qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour paying the securities and exchange commission $ in october to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep wall street happy. mci is the us s second-biggest long distance firm after at&t. consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. a merger between mci and verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october. last week sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about $. buying mci would give either qwest or verizon access to mci s global network and business-based subscribers. the rationale is similar to the one underpinning sbc s at&t deal. verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.

962,german music in a zombie state the german music business - the third largest in the world - is in the state of a zombie because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy a leading industry figure has said. tim renner the head of universal music germany until last year told bbc world service s the music biz programme that the country s music industry was now struggling to survive. renner warned that unless the industry accepted new realties - such as downloading - its decline could become irreversible. the problem the music industry has got is that they aren t willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out he stated. so the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie. the music market in germany peaked in with sales of . euros (£.). since sales have plummeted to just . euros (£.) in . in the space of one year - between and - cd album sales fell by .%. but a study by the society for consumer research found that at the same time more than twice as many recordable cds had music recorded on them than cd albums were sold. mr renner pointed out that because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good-selling record this was particularly damaging. you need time he added. however peter zombic the managing director of the international federation of phonographic industry in germany said he did not feel the situation was as dramatic as mr renner believed. it s quite true that we have severe problems in germany - but that s true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too he argued. we have a severe problem with piracy especially internet piracy and we also have a severe problem of private copying. i don t agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact especially in regard to germany talent the market is quite successful. he did however admit that copyright owners have partly lost control of their copyright due to piracy and copying. but he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading. we were the first to implement a download service - back in he argued. at that time it was not successful because of the advent of piracy - it was the napster time when services became popular. it still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned. mr zombic also called for a change to the perception in germany that private copying of music is not a problem. german law does allow people to make copies of cds for their family and close friends without fear of breaking copyright. mr zombic said that this legal framework was a huge problem . there is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby it s nice it s fun he added. we try to make clear it s not nice and it s not fun - it s endangering the creativity in our country.

69,indonesia declines debt freeze indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the paris club group of creditors economics minister aburizal bakrie has reportedly said. indonesia which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer owes the paris club about $ (£.). mr bakrie told the bisnis indonesia newspaper that a $. donors aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary. this aid comes on top of a previously-pledged $. package. most of this normal aid would be used to finance the country s budget deficit. the indonesian economics minister explained that the money - $. in grants and $ in soft loans - was for the rebuilding of aceh province which was badly hit by the tsunami of december. nevertheless one of mr bakrie s deputies mahendra siregar told afp news agency that indonesia was still considering the offer by the paris club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments. what is true is that we are still discussing... the paris club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium. that s how far we are at this stage said mr siregar. the member countries of the paris club are owed about $ this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the indian ocean tsunami. indonesia sri lanka and the seychelles accepted the paris club offer which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little. thailand and india have however declined the offer with thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while india said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid. putting off payments may lower a country s rating among financial organisations making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future analysts said. separately the indonesian government has said it will announce monthly how much it has received in foreign donations and how it has spent the money. welfare minister alwi shihab told ap news agency that this announcement should allay suspicion of official corruption in relief operations.
1757,nuclear body seeks new tech the computer systems used to monitor the world s nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors. a spokesman for the international atomic energy agency (iaea) said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than years old. such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide. the agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software. a major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate secure online access to information said project manager livio costantini. iaea inspectors make around visits a year to more than nuclear facilities worldwide. they are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants to carry out environmental checks and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility. the computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits for instance was built in the and largely paper based. an iaea spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack. the organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in november aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data design blueprints of nuclear facilities even satellite images of the plant. where possible it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials. further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries according to a spokesman. computer specialist at the iaea peter smith would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques more familiar to video games players into the inspector s toolkit. the commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world he said. if we could have that on our laptops we could be walking through the plant seeing on the laptop how the plant should look. and if there s a door in the wall that is not on our laptop then we have a problem. the iaea estimates the total cost of the four-year project to upgrade its technology will be $. so far it has only received $ from the us and the uk. failure to replace the hardware and software and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks said an agency statement.
290,yukos seeks court action on sale yukos will return to a us court on wednesday to seek sanctions against baikal finance group the little-known firm which has bought its main asset. yukos has said it will sue baikal and others involved in the sale of yuganskneftegas for $ in damages. yukos us lawyers will attempt to have baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale. baikal s background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear. russian newspapers have claimed that baikal - which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $. ( roubles £.) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas russia s fourth-biggest oil producer. many observers believe that the unit which produces % of yukos oil output could ultimately fall into the hands of surgutneftegas or even gazprom the state gas firm which opted out of the auction. the russian government forced the sale of yukos most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $ back tax bill it says the company owes. yukos us lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of us bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. on wednesday yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group. we believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us yukos spokesman mike lake told agence france press. if it exports that oil it will be marketing a stolen product he added. the future ownership of yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that baikal was established as a front for other interests. speaking on tuesday president putin said baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other russian energy firms interested in the development of yuganskneftegas. president putin also suggested that china s national petroleum corporation could play a role in the unit s future after signing a commercial agreement with gazprom to work on joint energy projects. yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company. commentators and yukos itself claim the firm is the target of a government campaign to destroy it because of the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky.

489,cairn shares slump on oil setback shares in cairn energy a uk oil firm have closed down % after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands. the company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its indian oil fields but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. it also said the indian government had told it to pay a production tax for which cairn argues it is not liable. cairn s shares have jumped by almost % this year. investors had piled into cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in india this year. chief executive bill gammell said on friday he was disappointed with exploration in the so-called n-c extension area in rajasthan. investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. but cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a significant downgrade of the initial expectation . cairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. the company said the rate would be about rupees ($.; £.) per tonne or seven barrels of oil. a spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe % of the field s current value. cairn refutes the government s position mr gammell said. he insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - india s state-run oil & natural gas corp (ongc) - and not the contractor. we have a pretty strong legal case here he added saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. investors took a dim view of the statements though. the shares closed down or % at pence. i think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves said analyst jason kenney at ing. the disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for cairn s existing oilfields. the company raised targets for its mangala and aishwariya fields in india from barrels a day to between and barrels a day. its mangala field thought to contain a billion barrels is its biggest find to date. these two fields will provide the core of the future developments in rajasthan mr gammell said. cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. mr gammell set up the company in the and has successfully switched its focus to south asia from interests in the us and europe. cairn which also operates in nepal and bangladesh was catapulted into the ftse index of leading uk shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.
590,ba to suspend two saudi services british airways is to halt its flights from london heathrow to jeddah and riyadh in saudi arabia from march. the airline said the decision was a commercial one due to reduced passenger demand for the services. ba currently operates four flights per week from heathrow to jeddah and three weekly journeys to riyadh. it suspended flights to saudi arabia for three weeks in autumn after a government warning about a threat to uk aviation interests in saudi arabia . ba will now suspend the saudi flights - which it says will remain under constant review - from march. the decision to suspend flights between the uk and saudi arabia is a difficult one to make as we have enjoyed a long history of flying between the two countries said ba director of commercial planning robert boyle. however the routes don t currently make a profitable contribution to our business and we are unable to sustain them while this remains the case. passengers with flights booked after the suspension date will be contacted by ba for alternative arrangements to be made.
158,uk firms embracing e-commerce uk firms are embracing internet trading opportunities as never before e-commerce minister mike o brien says. a government-commissioned study ranked the uk third in its world index of use of information and communication technology (ict). the report suggests % of uk firms are now using broadband and that % of micro businesses are trading online. mr o brien said uk businesses were sprinting forward in ict use but that there were more challenges ahead. the report carried out independently by consultants booz allen hamilton and hi europe placed the uk third behind sweden and ireland for business use of ict. it showed british business brought greater maturity to their ict use by using broadband in increased numbers bringing ict into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. mr o brien said: the increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that uk companies are embracing the opportunities that ict can bring. it is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years. the government would play its part in cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish mr o brien said. the clear message the report sends is that effective use of ict can bring real improvements in business performance for all business. however we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the uk is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy he added. the international benchmarking study was based on telephone interviews with businesses of which more than were uk businesses. it is the eighth in a series of examining the adoption and deployment of ict in the world s most industrialised nations.

976,radcliffe proves doubters wrong this won t go down as one of the greatest marathons of paula s career. but as a test of character it was the toughest race she s ever taken part in. a win in the new york marathon doesn t make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year. if paula s last experience of the year had been athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism. she can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future. even if she d lost this race there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it. she knows she can dig deep if she needs to. it was a strong field with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning. and although two hours minutes wasn t one of paula s best times it wasn t far off the record on a difficult course. i was speaking to paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation. she thought that if she won people would say why couldn t she do that in athens and if she lost people would say her career was over. and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and in athens. but that was never on the cards. she might have been beaten but she would have kept running. the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens - the niggling injuries her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions - weren t at play here. the only question was what position she could finish in. most important of all despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race there were never doubts in paula s mind. if she wasn t confident she wouldn t have run. after all if you re the best in the world at an event you ll always have expectations of winning. now paula will take part in the run london race in london at the end of the year have a well-earned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.

(£.) in revenue. sk telecom of south korea which is launching a tv to mobile service (via satellite) in may plans to charge a flat fee of $ a month for its channels of video and channels of audio. it will be able to offer an additional two pay tv channels using conditional access technology. mr shin-bae kim chief executive of sk telecom also at said: we have plans to integrate tv with mobile internet services. this will enable viewers to access the mobile internet to get more information on adverts they see on tv. there will be handsets available for the launch of the korean service. lg electronics of south korea was demonstrating one at that could display video at frames a second. footage shown on the handset was clear and watchable. a speech on mobile tv by angel gambino of the bbc also drew a large crowd suggesting that even those mobile operators and equipment vendors which are not particularly active in mobile tv yet are starting to look into it. but all is not simple and straightforward in the mobile tv arena. there is a battle for supremacy between two competing standards: dvb-h for digital video broadcasting for handsets and dmb for digital multimedia broadcasting. dr chan yeob yeun vice president and research fellow in charge of mobile tv at lg electronics said: dmb offers twice the number of frames a minute as dvb-h and does not drain mobile batteries as quickly. the japanese koreans and ericsson of sweden are backing dmb. samsung of south korea has a dmb phone too that will be one of those offered to users of the tu media satellite mobile tv service to be launched in korea in may. nokia by contrast is backing dvb-h and is involved in mobile tv trials that use its art-deco style media phone which has a larger than usual screen for tv or visual radio (a way of accompanying a radio programme with related text and pictures). mobile operators and vodafone are among the operators trialling mobile tv. but even if the standards battle is resolved there is the thorny issue of broadcasting rights. ms gambino says the bbc now negotiates mobile rights when it is negotiating content. for those not convinced mobile users will want to watch tv on their handsets digital audio broadcasting may provide a good compromise and better sound quality than conventional radio. developments in this area are continuing. at a dab conference in cannes several makers of dab chips for mobiles announced smaller lower- cost chips which consume less power. among the chip companies present were frontier silicon and radioscape. the jury is still out on whether tv and digital radio on mobiles will make much money for anyone. but with many new services going live soon it won t be long before the industry finds out.

1450,boateng to step down at election paul boateng chief secretary to the treasury is to step down as a labour mp at the forthcoming general election. mr boateng is to become the uk s high commissioner to south africa. he was the uk s first black cabinet minister when appointed to his post in promoted from the home office where he had been prisons minister. mr boateng served on the greater london council before being elected to parliament in declaring today brent south tomorrow soweto . he will succeed the previous high commissioner ann grant shortly after the next election which is widely expected to be held on may. the appointment is dependent on labour s re-election. prime minister tony blair said: paul has been both a valued colleague and a trusted friend for many years. he has made an immense contribution to public life in britain and i am delighted that he has agreed to continue that service to the people of britain by acting as their representative in south africa. chancellor gordon brown said: over the past eight years paul s contribution to the treasury and the government has been exceptional - and it has been my privilege to have worked closely with him closely at the treasury. i congratulate paul on his new appointment. he has displayed huge dedication to the cause of african development for many years and it is fitting that in this year of challenge and opportunity for the african continent paul has been given such a pivotal role in our fight against poverty and injustice. i look forward to continuing to work with paul on this vital agenda. mr boateng said: i am honoured to be asked to take on this role especially as it comes at such an integral time for our relationship with south africa and the african continent. there shall be many new challenges and opportunities ahead and i look forward to embracing them with great anticipation. asked if he was appointed as the result of a fair and open competition he replied: i have been appointed as a result of a process that s been used before by labour and conservative governments to appoint people of all parties who have relevant experience. mr boateng also laughed off suggestions that his re-election in brent south seat had been in danger saying it was one of the safest labour seats in the country . shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said that if in government he would refuse to approve either mr boateng s appointment or that of ex-cabinet minister helen liddell as high commissioner to australia. mr blair s appointment of paul boateng is the latest example of a worrying trend of failed tony s cronies being appointed to senior diplomatic posts he said.
1007,child access law shake-up planned parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied lord falconer said. the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday. he denied fathers activists had forced the changes telling the bbc there is a recognition that something is wrong . between and couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year although in nine out of separations there is no court intervention. lord falconer told bbc radio s today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. but he opposed compulsory mediation saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. other plans include: - parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements based on real-life examples that have worked in the past - extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases - better access to legal emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet - legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes. judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a nuclear option which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child s interests a spokesman said. the aim of the new legislation was to provide a medium range of penalties such as fines community service orders compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews. failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents lord falconer said: tagging may be going too far but let s have a debate about that. full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published in the next two weeks a spokesman said. the government s proposals have met with disapproval from fathers rights groups. john ison from the controversial group fathers justice said: it is very disappointing. what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation. jim parton from families need fathers said the new proposals lacked compulsion . we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand you know what the minimum access is. otherwise you see people make agreements which then fall apart. mr parton said he had been told by children s minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election which is likely to take place in may. the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. theresa may shadow secretary for the family told bbc radio s today programme that the government s plans were inadequate and were papering over the cracks of the current system . she said a conservative government would bring a radical reform of the family courts as well as enforcing a legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation . we want to make courts the last resort rather than the first resort she added. the government says children cannot simply be divided up like property when a marriage collapses. the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules rather than having rigid targets .
462,musical future for phones analyst bill thompson has seen the future and it is in his son s hands. i bought my son max a phone partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone and partly because i am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought i should see how they work in real life. after using it for a while i am not at all tempted to get rid of my sonyericsson smart phone. that has a relatively large screen even if it does only have slower gprs access to the network. i can read my e-mail surf the web using a proper browser and write stuff using the stylus on its touch screen. last week someone e-mailed me a document that had been compressed into a zip file and i was pleasantly surprised to discover that my phone even knew how to decompress it for me. by contrast the confusing menus complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max s phone simply get in the way and i did not see much value in the paid-for services especially the limited web access. the videos of entertainment news horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal and i did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image never mind micro-tv. but then max started playing and i realised i was missing the point entirely. it is certainly not a great overall experience but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout: the video content itself is compelling. the quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the bbc website and the image is about the same size. max was completely captivated and i was intrigued to discover that i had nearly missed the next stage of the network revolution. it is easy to be dismissive of small screens and indeed anyone of my generation with failing eyesight and the view that there s never anything worth watching on tv is hardly going to embrace these phones. but just as the world wide web was the killer application that drove internet adoption music videos are going to drive adoption. with vodafone now pushing its own service and already established in the uk video on the phone is clearly going to become a must-have for kids sitting on the school bus adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress. this will please the network operators who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired licences. but it goes deeper than that: playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the download and play model we have all accepted for our ipods and players. after all why should i want to carry of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when i can simply listen to anything i want whenever i want streamed to my phone oh - and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts something which ensures that it is always in someone s pocket or handbag available for other uses too. i have never really approved of using the internet protocol (ip) to do either audio or video streaming and i think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using voice over ip . but i have to acknowledge that the net at least here in the developed western countries is fast and reliable enough to do both. i stream radio to my computer while i work and enjoy hearing the bizarre stations from around the world that i can find online but nowhere else. i am even playing with internet telephony despite my reservations and i appear on go digital on the world service streamed over the web each week. but networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming both for voice and video which gives them an edge over net-based ip services. the services aren t quite there yet and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges. vodafone will let you access its services on vodafone live! as part of your subscription cost but it makes you pay by the megabyte to download from other sites - this one for example. this will not matter to business users but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone company s collection of partner sites something that should perhaps be worrying telecoms regulator ofcom. but we should not see these new phones simply as cut-down network terminals. if i want fast access to my e-mail i can get a card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network. the phone is a lot more and it is as a combination of mini-tv personal communications device and music/video player that it really works. there is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices accessing a wide range of services over different networks. phones and ipods can co-exist at least for a while but if i had to bet on the long term i would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket. or perhaps some enterprising manufacturer will offer me both. an player anyone bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.
151,slim playstation triples sales sony playstation s slimmer shape has proved popular with uk gamers with sold in its first week on sale. sales have tripled since launch outstripping microsoft s xbox said market analysts chart-track. the numbers were also boosted by the release of the -only game grand theft auto: san andreas. the title broke the uk sales record for video games in its first weekend of release. latest figures suggest it has sold more than copies. it is obviously very very encouraging for sony because microsoft briefly outsold them last week john houlihan editor of computerandvideogames.com told bbc news. and with halo [for xbox] out next week it really is a head-to-head contest between them and xbox. although xbox sales over the last week also climbed sales were more than double that. the figures mean sony is reaching the seven million barrier for uk sales of the console. edinburgh-based developer rockstar which is behind the gta titles has seen san andreas pull in an estimated £ in gross revenues over the weekend. in comparison blockbuster films like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban took £. in its first three days at the uk box office. the lord of the rings: the return of the king took nearly £ over its opening weekend although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets. gangster-themed gta san andreas is the sequel to grand theft auto vice city which previously held the record for the fastest-selling video game ever. the xbox game halo released on november in the uk is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year. the original title won universal acclaim in and sold more than four million copies. mr houlihan added that sony had done well with the but it definitely helped that the release of san andreas coincided with the slimline hitting the shelves. the run-up to christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. microsoft s xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales. the sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand since gta san andreas has an certificate. sony and microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in . both have hit crucial price points at around £ and that really does open up new consoles to new audience plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales said mr houlihan.
946,tories outlining policing plans local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner under plans unveiled by the conservatives. party leader michael howard said the new role would replace inconspicuous police authorities. he said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. the lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing while labour criticised extravagant tory promises on policing. responding to the plans the chairman of the police federation of england and wales which represents rank and file officers said it was essential operational independence was retained. jan berry said: it is a service not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground she warned. outlining his crime manifesto mr howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates. the commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have he told bbc radio s today programme. the trouble is and it s no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are. mr howard said the authorities were not providing the local accountability that we want to see and that elected police commissioners would be more visible. critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. lord harris who sits on the executive of association of police authorities said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician. that is overturning nearly years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions he said. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the plan was dangerous and could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials . mr oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a minimum policing guarantee with their chief constables. a labour party spokesman criticised michael howard s record saying police numbers had fallen by when he was home secretary. he said: today the tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system. the tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an american sheriff. other tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.
1394,bad e-mail habits sustains spam the bad behaviour of e-mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry a new study has found. according to a survey conducted by security firm mirapoint and market research company the radicati group nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. one in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts. the fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little the report concludes. this preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us said marcel nienhuis market analyst at the radicati group. it explains why e-mail security threats including spam viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate he said accusing users of bad e-mail behaviour . spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the month according to security firm clearswift. it has recently seen a rise in the number of spam messages offering phoney sony psp giveaways. and in perhaps a nod to the popularity of the american drama series desperate housewives it has also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking for casual sex. but rather than finding a companion users who click on such mail will find themselves redirected to porn sites where they run the risk of downloading spyware on to their pc. clearswift has seen a % rise in sex-related spam over the course of the last month. without casting aspersions those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that one thing leads to another but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems said alyn hockey clearswift s director of research. sexually explicit terms make up % of security firm sophos top word that spammers most commonly try to disguise in order to beat anti-spam filters. spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by-pass anti-spam software said graham cluley senior technology consultant for security firm sophos. the list of words most commonly hidden by the spammers from anti-spam software reveals that most spam is about the old favourites: money drugs and sex said mr cluley. but anti-spam filters can only be part of the solution to the menace of junk e-mail. people must resist their basic instincts to buy from spam mails. spammers are criminals plain and simple. if no-one responded to junk e-mail and didn t buy products sold in this way then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs he said.
203,how to make a gigapixel picture the largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the netherlands. the finished image is . billion pixels in size - making it about times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras. the huge image of delft was created by stitching together single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot. if printed out in standard dots per inch resolution the picture would be . high and long. the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures. tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. the website is already proving popular and currently has more than visitors every day. the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the . gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge. the goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november . that image portrayed bryce canyon national park in utah and was made up of separate photographs. the panorama of delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in mr lyons image. he did it all by hand which was an enormous effort and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques it would be feasible to build a larger image said jurgen den hartog one of the tno researchers behind the project. we were not competing with mr lyons but it started as a lunchtime bet. the dutch team used already available technologies although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image. we had to rewrite almost all the tools me den hartog told the bbc news website. all standard windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image so we had to develop one ourselves. the component pictures were taken on july by a computer-controlled camera with a mm lens. each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite. the stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful pcs over three days. following the success of this project and with promises of help from others the tno team is considering creating a full -degree panoramic view of another dutch city with even higher resolution.
896,troubled marsh under sec scrutiny the us stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker marsh & mclennan s shareholder transactions the firm has said. the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of % or more of the firm s shares. marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the sec investigation. marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the new york attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. since that inquiry was launched in october marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. prosecutors allege that marsh - the world s biggest insurance broker - and other us insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. this is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by new york s top law officer eliot spitzer and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the state of california. the sec s investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the trident funds managed by mmc capital the company s private equity firm. marsh s new chief executive michael cherkasky is trying to negotiate a settlement with mr spitzer. mr spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate america s misdeeds. the uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - standard & poor s moody s and fitch - to downgrade marsh in recent weeks. according to the financial times insurance analysts are now questioning whether marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year. doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind.
1076,paraguay novel wins us book prize a novel set in century paraguay has won the $ (£ ) fiction prize at the us national book awards. lily tuck s the news from paraguay is a fictionalised tale about paraguayan leader francisco solano lopez and his irish mistress. but the annual awards which were presented in new york on wednesday were not without controversy. children s author judy blume who was given an honourary medal used the ceremony to speak out over censorship. sales of blume s books have exceeded million but her work - which features frank narratives about families religion and sexuality - is closely watched by the censors. blume said: the urge to ban is contagious. it spreads like wildfire from community to community. please speak out. censors hate publicity. her medal marks the second year in a row the honourary prize went to someone as notable for popular success as literary greatness. last year s honorary winner stephen king accused the industry during the ceremony of snobbery against popular writers. but his argument that the award should help sell books instead of honouring excellence is not shared by everyone. this year s fiction panel overlooked high-profile works such as philip roth s the plot against america and instead chose five little-known books all by new york-based women. one fiction judge stewart o nan carried around a note written on a napkin that said: i would hope that our caring more for the quality of a work than its sales figures make us a friend of books not an enemy. the national book awards non-fiction prize was awarded to kevin boyle s for arc of justice which focuses on a black family s fight to live in a white detroit neighbourhood in the . the award had created a lot of interest this year after the surprise inclusion of the of the - commission report looking into the events of the september terrorist attacks on the us. pete hautman won the young people s literature prize for his novel godless. the winner in the poetry category was jean valentine for door in the mountain: new and collected poems -.
1893,mobiles get set for visual radio the growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked. games cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years but could see another big innovation that won t just see a change in our mobile phone habits - it might alter the way we listen to the radio. finnish handset giant nokia has been working on a technology called visual radio which takes an existing fm signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures. it is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested - the early days of dab digital radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day. one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius a senior project manager at nokia was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium. he said: i m very happy to say it s not television what we re talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today. if you have a visual radio enabled handset when you hear an artist you don t know or there s a competition or vote that you d like to participate in you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on-air broadcast you ve just been listening to. that visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to. as well as details on the track or artist of a particular song there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself in a similar way to digital television s red button content. possible interactive content includes competitions votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing. but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real-time basis. this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners. as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network. and there will be a cost for the service as well although it may depend on your usage. if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it ll be two or three pounds per month said mr wasenius. but typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an all you can eat arrangement per month. the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial-up connections. one thing that is for sure - assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets it is estimating that there will be million visual radio-enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of . basically visual radio is not really revolutionary but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before. the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in a few months time with virgin radio who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners. station manager steve taylor commented: listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way. not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like; music downloads and the latest gig tickets. initially visual radio functionality will be limited to two nokia handsets due out soon - the and - but if successful it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them. listen again to the interview on the radio five live website.
1113,satellite mapping aids darfur relief aid workers trying to house feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the sudanese region of darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology. a european consortium of companies and university groups known as respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps. the aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly. respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks for the rivers and for the villages to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes said einar bjorgo from unosat the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium. the group uses satellites from nasa the european space agency and the disaster monitoring constellation. the satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. from there the information makes its way to respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data. you have to convert the data into images then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis damage or situation maps said stefan voigt who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations the german aerospace centre. this kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but respond gets it done in about hours. our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery reading satellite maps so it s our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very very efficiently said mr voigt. respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web and on compact disc. but the best map is one you can hold in your hands especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce. a map is a working document explains herbert hansen of respond s belgian partner keyobs. you need to use it you need to write on it correct give feedback and so on so you need paper to write on. we print maps we laminate the maps we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map it s completely protected. humanitarian groups in darfur have been making good use of respond s maps. they have come in especially handy during sudan s rainy season when normally dry riverbeds or wadis became flooded. these wadis had a very small amount of flooding generally in terms of depth but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground says stephen candillon of respond imaging partner sertit. respond s rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times. aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production
1150,intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has said it has found a way to put a silicon-based laser on a chip raising hopes of much faster networks. scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade. we ve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel s photonics technology lab. writing in the journal nature dr paniccia - and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it. telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved. we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia. while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said. but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy-to-make filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. it s a technical validation that it can work he said.
1151,khodorkovsky quits yukos shares jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky has transferred his controlling stake in oil giant yukos to a business partner. mr khodorkovsky handed over his entire .% stake in holding company group menatep - which controls yukos - to leonid nevzlin. a close ally of the ex-yukos boss mr nevzlin is currently based in israel. mr khodorkovsky handed over his stake after the forced sale of yukos core oil production unit yuganskneftegaz to pay a giant tax bill. yuganskneftegaz was sold off at auction in december last year eventually falling into the hands of state oil firm rosneft in a deal worth $. (£). since the sale of yuganskneftegaz i have been delivered of (all) responsibility for the business that remains and the group s money as a whole mr khodorkovsky said. it is all over. as before i see my future in public activity to build a civil society in russia. mr nevzlin is yukos largest shareholder but is living in self-imposed exile in israel. yuganskneftegaz pumps around million barrels of oil a day. it was sold by the russian authorities to recover government tax claims against yukos totalling over $. previously considered to be russia s richest man with an estimated fortune of $ mr khodorkovsky is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion following his arrest in october . however the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of a drive by russian president vladimir putin to rein in the country s super-rich business leaders the so-called oligarchs. it is also believed that mr khodorkovsky was particularly targeted because he had started to bankroll political opponents of mr putin.

266,wolves appoint hoddle as manager glenn hoddle has been unveiled as the new wolves manager. the ex-england coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed dave jones who was sacked after the club s poor start to the season. wolves chairman rick hayward said: we re delighted glenn is here. he has a six-month contract so we can test each other out and see if it works. hoddle who will work alongside stuart gray has been out of the game since he was sacked by spurs in . gray who has been caretaker manager was assistant boss when hoddle was manager at southampton. i m delighted to be here said hoddle. i saw the massive potential that wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the premiership parallels my ambitions. stuart gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager. we ve worked together at southampton and i m delighted to be back with him. wolves chief executive jez moxey defended the decision to give hoddle a short-term contract. we hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term he said. most managers want a four-year contract and then expect it to be paid off if it doesn t work out. for somebody of glenn s calibre to come in on a short-term contract and put his reputation on the line it demonstrates his commitment and self-belief and the potential he thinks is here. hayward revealed that hoddle was one of the first to be approached after jones departure. he was not available at the time because he was looking at various other things he explained. five weeks later we re back on track and this a tremendous opportunity for wolves. hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with swindon before moving on to chelsea and then taking up the england job. his spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the world cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. the -year-old later returned to management with southampton where he again succeeded jones - as he has now done at wolves. he engineered an upturn in saints fortunes before being lured to white hart lane by tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. that relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the london club early last season. since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of france manager and had also been linked with a return to southampton. wolves are currently in the championship and have a home game against millwall on tuesday.

2201,ban on forced retirement under employers will no longer be able to force workers to retire before unless they can justify it. the government has announced that firms will be barred from from imposing arbitrary retirement ages. under new european age discrimination rules a default retirement age of will be introduced. workers will be permitted to request staying on beyond this compulsory retirement age although employers will have the right to refuse. trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said people would not be forced to work longer than they wanted saying the default age was not a statutory compulsory retirement age. she said employers would be free to continue employing people for as long as they were competent. under age discrimination proposals from the department of trade and industry last year workers were to be allowed to work on till if they wished. business leaders had opposed the plan as they said it would be too costly and cumbersome. the british chambers of commerce welcomed the latest proposal. this move today is the best of both worlds it said. employers have the ability to define the end point of the employer-employee relationship and employees have flexibility with a right to request to work past the age of . but age concern said imposing a retirement age of was cowardly and a complete u-turn . this makes a mockery of the government s so-called commitment to outlawing ageism leaving the incoming age discrimination law to unravel said gordon lishman director general of age concern england . it is now inevitable that older people will mount legal challenges to the decision using european law. the decision will have no impact on the age at which workers can collect their state pension the government has said.

1742,technology gets the creative bug the hi-tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required. often this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision. but that dance is growing more intimate as hi-tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration. and vice versa. uk telco bt is serious about the idea and has launched its connected world initiative. the idea says bt is to shape a century model which will help cement the art technology and business worlds together. we are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology said frank stone head of the bt s business sector programmes. he looks after several centres of excellence which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations one of which is focused on creative industries. to mark the initiative s launch a major international art installation is to open on april in brussels with a further exhibit in madrid later in the summer. they have both been created using the telco s technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm including a sophisticated graphics rendering program. using a graphics engine the type commonly used in gaming bafta-winning artists langlands & bell have created a virtual story-based model of brussels coudenberg cellars. they have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of coudenberg palace an historical seat of european power. the world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the century. the river was integral to the city s survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared said the artists. we hope that by uncovering the river we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present and appreciate the flow of modernity once concealing but now revealing the river senne. in their previous works they used the quake game graphics engine. the game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering game ai and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game. they are so time-consuming and expensive to create the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics-intensive games. bt s own engine tara (total abstract rendering architecture) has been in development since and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners. it was also used in in encounter an urban-based pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical on-the-street action. because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds new features were added to tara in order to handle the complex data sets. but collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new and many keen coders designers games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself. as more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance creativity will become an integral part of technology. the orange expressionist exhibition last year for example displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the uk to create an interactive installation. technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential not least because it gives people something to do with their technology. big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too. the art world is fantastically rich said mr stone with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like bt want to get in with them. between and the creative industry brought £ billion to london alone. it is an industry that is growing by % a year too. the partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net according to mr stone. this is not just about putting art galleries and museums online he said. it is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem. with broadband penetration reaching % in the uk businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it. the creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously. it is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries or more patent ideas for tech companies. what we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking. we are creating a future cultural drive for the economy said mr stone.
1881,woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down. there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council - led by lord woolf - published its proposals for england and wales. it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. but that has now been changed to one-sixth with no reduction for those killers given a whole life tariff . at the time lord woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation he said. but director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public . the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide . in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council (sgc) the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence . where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said. in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said: i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines. i am confident as a result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending. director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament. what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process. it represents a tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said.
2141,blogs take on the mainstream web logs or blogs are everywhere with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow. these online diaries come in many shapes and styles ranging from people willing to sharing their views pictures and links to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. most blogs may have only a small readership but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. the most well-known examples include iraqi salam pax s accounts of the us-led war former iranian vice-president mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic s government and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign. there are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs like wikinews.com launched last november. the blogging movement has been building up for many years. andrew nachison director of the media center a us-based think-tank that studies media technology and society highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. you could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before he says. and blogs were a key part of that transformation. among them were blogs carrying picture messages saying we are sorry for george w bush s victory and the responses from his supporters. mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers tv and radio. we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas he told the bbc news website. but they followed the story they didn t lead it. some parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs. others like the french newspaper le monde have applied a different strategy offering blogs as part of its content. i don t think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. it is in transition as society itself is in transition says mr nachison. however he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. the one-to-many road of traditional journalism yes it is threatened. and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse says mr nachison. the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what s acceptable for public consumption and what isn t that s gone forever. with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets like camera or video phones we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories. it seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger. but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing in a web already overloaded with information. blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence the so-called blogosphere has already exceeded five million and is growing at exponential levels. tools such as google s blogger movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog. us research think-tank pew internet & american life says a blog is created every . seconds although less than % of the total are updated at least once every two months. but experts agree that the phenomenon allowing individuals to publish share ideas exchange information comment on current issues post images or video on the web easily is here to stay. we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other said mr nachison. and there s going to be bad that comes with the good.

283,plan to give elderly care control elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans. ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves not social workers should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. they also plan a supremo for adult services in each english area to get different agencies working together. but the government shunned opponents calls for free long-term care. there are . people needing care in england and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by . monday s consultation paper on social care for adults in england is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency. health minister stephen ladyman said: this document is the antithesis of the nanny state. it s about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more. the government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been disappointing . ministers say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in some local councils to use the payments. they also want to set up a new half-way house where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that individual budget . the scheme will be funded on existing budgets set until . but mr ladyman said the plans could deliver savings in some areas such as freeing up nhs beds and preventing illnesses. he ruled out free personal care in england - which is on offer in scotland and wales saying it was unsustainable . david rogers from the local government association said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government. and tony hunter president of the association of directors of social services said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. but age concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle but not in practice. its director general gordon lishman said: direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally. the tories say people who pay for three years long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives. tory spokesman simon burns said more than long term care places had been lost since . after eight years of persistent change dogmatic enforcement of regulation and overbearing government initiatives - we need action not a vision said mr burns. the lib dems say they would fund free personal care by a new % tax rate on incomes over £ . health spokesman paul burstow said: promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share. but the risk is that independence can turn into isolation if the right support and care is not available.

2026,job cuts false economy - tuc plans to shed civil service jobs will prove to be a false economy that could hamper public sector reforms according to a tuc report. public and commercial services union members have already voted to strike over cuts for one day on november. the tuc said cuts would deliver less than % of the £ ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms. general secretary brendan barber warned the costs could easily outweigh the benefits . the government s big boost to public spending is now showing results said mr barber. public services are improving but looking for simple savings through job cuts at this stage could be a false economy. they may shoot a tory fox but cutting thousands of civil service jobs will hit the morale and capabilities of the public servants expected to implement government reforms. the costs could easily outweigh the benefits. next friday s strike action by the pcs is the biggest in the civil service since hitting jobcentres benefit agencies pensions offices customs and driving tests. the union says it is concerned about pensions sick pay and forced relocation as well as the cut in jobs. last month it was announced that a total of social security offices and jobcentres across the uk would close in the first wave of plans to shed civil service jobs. the number of civil servants in britain rose to more than in april. other areas the strike will affect include passports museums and galleries libraries and health and safety inspections.

2045,benitez delight after crucial win liverpool manager rafael benitez admitted victory against deportivo la coruna was vital in their tight champions league group. jorge andrade s early own goal gave liverpool a - win. and benitez said: we started at a very high tempo and had many chances. it is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals. we were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack. we are pleased but move on to the next game. igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso and benitez said: he played very well. it is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level. benitez added: it is all back in our own hands now it was a great win for us and i was delighted with what i feel was the best liverpool i have seen. as far as my feelings about winning in spain that is really not important. i want to see us win away matches in the champions league that it was in spain was not my first consideration. as far as i am concerned it is important for liverpool to win it is not important in what country it is in. benitez added: benitez said: we had a problem before the start it was decided that xabi could not play more than minutes. but in the end because of the way that (dietmar) hamann and (igor) biscan performed we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match. depor are a good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed. but we knew that if we hit them on the counter-attack it would make them nervous and that is how it worked out. deportivo coach javier irureta said: liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down. i know we have now gone six games at home in europe without scoring but that does not reflect our overall performances. but this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination. the goal was a bad mistake and a big blow to our confidence. players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it. i know we are bottom of the group but as long as there is hope of qualifying we will hang on to that.
2059,blair and brown criticised by mps labour mps have angrily criticised tony blair and gordon brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men. a meeting of the parliamentary labour party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise labour s election hopes. the pm insisted nothing would derail labour s campaign despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside. mr brown will again be in the public eye at the party s new poster launch. in what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity he is due to line up alongside alan milburn - the man controversially appointed as the party s election supremo - and deputy leader john prescott for the event in london on tuesday. relations between mr brown and mr milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since mr blair brought the latter back into the cabinet to run labour s election campaign a role successfully carried out by mr brown in both and . mr blair told the parliamentary labour party on monday: i know from everyone here in cabinet and government nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need. the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the plp and were seemingly in good spirits as it started. new speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in brown s britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston which suggested mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown. labour s paul flynn said mr blair and mr brown had a scorching from mps adding: it was a parliamentary labour party meeting like no other. backbencher stephen pound said some mps had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if mr blair and mr brown did not stop this nonsense this poisonous briefing . lord campbell-savours a former mp challenged mr brown to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said. mr prescott said mps were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports. they told us very clearly it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line he told bbc radio s today on tuesday. mr prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government. but he argued mr blair and mr brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services. the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war. he had then changed his mind in june following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him writes mr peston. mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. of course as a waiter for years i have a professional ability here he joked. mr blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while mr brown says he will not let gossip distract him from helping a unified election campaign. the conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the liberal democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government.

887,minister defends hunting ban law the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales is enforceable and very clear alun michael has said. the rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law which came into force on friday and pretended they were not. some hunts met legally on saturday killing a total of foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds. but anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts. countryside alliance chairman john jackson said that saturday had been a massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting . people had turned out to show en masse that the hunting act was a bad law he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed legally as far as he was aware. although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence exercising hounds chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable mr michael told bbc radio s today programme: there has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting. the reality is that the law is very clear. you can t chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer. if people do so and pretend they re not it s going to become very clear. you can t hunt accidentally. mr michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. he said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy the health service and their children s future than hunting. but the league against cruel sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. thousands of hunt supporters turned out at hunts across england and wales on the first day of the ban with anti-hunt groups sending out monitors to check the law was not being broken. there were only four arrests - over alleged hunting of hares in wiltshire - although it was not clear whether they were made under the hunting act. they have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. but penny little who monitored the bicester hunt in oxfordshire said she had witnessed gratuitous spiteful killing of foxes . if people tried to run circles around this law the only outcome would be that it was tightened up she said. mike hobday from the league against cruel sports said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police. he said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts. but mr jackson who had been at the bicester hunt in oxfordshire denied there was any intimidation.

1476,dollar slides ahead of new year the us dollar has hit a new record low against the euro and analysts predict that more declines are likely in . disappointing economic reports dented the currency which had been rallying after european policy makers said they were worried about the euro s strength. earlier on thursday the japanese yen touched its lowest versus the euro on concerns about economic growth in asia. currency markets have been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. this has amplified reactions analysts said adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in january. people want to go into the weekend and the new year positioned for a weaker buck said tim mazanec director of foreign exchange at investors bank and trust. the dollar slid to a record $. versus the euro on thursday before bouncing back to $.. against the yen the dollar was trading down at $.. the yen meanwhile dropped to . per euro in afternoon trading. it later strengthened to .. investors are concerned about the size of the us trade and budget deficits and are betting that george w bush s administration will allow the dollar to weaken despite saying they favour a strong currency. also playing on investors minds are mixed reports about the state of the us economy. on thursday disappointing business figures from chicago brought a sudden end to a rally in the value of the dollar. the national association of purchasing management-chicago said its index dropped to . more than analysts had expected. german chancellor gerhard schroeder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. mr berlusconi said the euro s strength was absolutely worrying for italian exports. mr schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances.
188,mcconnell in drunk remark row scotland s first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk once in a while . jack mcconnell was speaking to more than secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. he has been criticised by the snp for encouraging young people to get drunk. but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk . the first minister s comments came in a question and answer session at glenurquhart high school in inverness attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools. a highland councillor who was at the event has also defended mr mcconnell. margaret davidson the independent member for the loch ness west said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time. when one pupil asked mr mcconnell how the executive proposed to tackle under-age drinking began his response with the quip: i m sure there s no under-age drinking in the highlands. he went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions. he said: i hope i m not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people s health and their ability to control what s happening round about them. mr mcconnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes and on the health consequences of binge drinking. the one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that he said. far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly. we are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening. he added: by all means get drunk once in a while - but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly. snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said: this is an incredible gaffe by jack mcconnell. we all know that under-age drinking is an issue in scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician particularly the first minister should encourage young people to get drunk. the first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately. but an executive spokeswoman insisted mr mcconnell had made the remark with adults not youngsters in mind. he was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions - which are for the over- she said. it was just a recognition that people will get drunk but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable.
1223,fit-again betsen in france squad france have brought flanker serge betsen back into their squad to face england at twickenham on sunday. but the player who missed the victory over scotland through injury must attend a disciplinary hearing on wednesday after being cited by wasps. serge has a good case so we are confident he will play said france coach bernard laporte. the inexperienced nicolas mas jimmy marlu and jean-philippe grandclaude are also included in a -man squad. the trio have been called up after pieter de villiers ludovic valbon and aurelien rougerie all picked up injuries in france s - win on saturday. laporte said he was confident that betsen would be cleared by the panel investigating his alleged trip that broke wasps centre stuart abbott s leg. if he was to be suspended we would call up imanol harinordoquy or thomas lievremont said laporte who has dropped patrick tabacco. we missed serge badly against scotland. he has now recovered from his thigh injury and played on saturday with biarritz. france s regular back-row combination of betsen harinordoquy and olivier magne were all missing from france s side at the weekend because of injury. laporte is expected to announce france s starting line-up on wednesday. forwards: nicolas mas sylvain marconnet olivier milloud william servat sebastien bruno fabien pelous jerome thion gregory lamboley serge betsen julien bonnaire sebastien chabal yannick nyanga. backs: dimitri yachvili pierre mignoni frederic michalak yann delaigue damien traille brian liebenberg jean-philippe grandclaude christophe dominici jimmy marlu pepito elhorga.
1964,smith keen on home series return scotland manager walter smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the home international series. such a plan is to be proposed by the new chief executive of the northern irish fa howard wells at the next meeting of the four home countries. the english fa has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season. but smith said: bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that s something that s needed. the home international series was done away with in with the traditional scotland-england fixture continuing until . that game is one smith would be delighted to see reinstated. the scotland v england match was a highlight of the end of the season he added. i was in italy for their friendly with russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around fans turned up to watch. england were criticised for the - draw against holland - the way scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies. you have to put a performance on in friendly games. if you don t they can be de-motivating. it can be a dangerous road to go down if players don t apply themselves in the manner they should. so i would support the return of the home internationals - the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule.
1280,lords wrong on detainees - straw jack straw has attacked the decision by britain s highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws. the foreign secretary said the right to life was the most important liberty and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism. law lords were simply wrong to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. new home secretary charles clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed. the house of lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government s anti-terror policy. but mr straw denied it amounted to a constitutional crisis . he said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. the law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary he told bbc radio s today programme. the foreign secretary insisted it was for parliament and not judges to decide how best britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. but liberal democrat peer lord carlile the government s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. he said the law lords ruling was an embarrassment for the government and major changes were needed to the law. the ruling came on charles clarke s first day as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation. in a statement to mps mr clarke said: i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year. in the meantime we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords. the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. but those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. on thursday lord bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects but not britons. lord nicholls of birkenhead in his ruling said: indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law. in a statement detainee a in woodhill prison said: i hope now that the government will act upon this decision scrap this illegal law and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones. the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. solicitor gareth pierce who represents eight of the detainees claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to madness saying two were being held in broadmoor hospital.
1637,china aviation seeks rescue deal scandal-hit jet fuel supplier china aviation oil has offered to repay its creditors $ (£) of the $ it lost on trading in oil futures. the firm said it hoped to pay $ now and another $ over eight years. with assets of $ and liabilities totalling $ it needs creditors backing for the offer to avoid going into bankruptcy. the trading scandal is the biggest to hit singapore since the $. collapse of barings bank in . chen jiulin chief executive of china aviation oil (cao) was arrested by at changi airport by singapore police on december. he was returning from china where he had headed when cao announced its trading debacle in late-november. the firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during october but prices rose sharply instead. among the creditors whose backing cao needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as barclay s capital and sumitomo mitsui as well as south korean firm sk energy. of the immediate payment the firm - china s biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $ out of its own resources. the rest would come from its parent company china aviation oil holding company in beijing. the holding company owned by the chinese government holds most of cao s singapore-listed shares. it cut its holding from % to % on october.
1777,tevez - an argentine in brazil some years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil. he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige - which he failed to live up to. he left an impression but not for reasons he would have wanted. the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play. even today gandula is the term used in brazil for ballboy. brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then and many will delight now if history is repeated. another boca juniors player is coming to brazil. the new maradona - carlos tevez - is joining corinthians for nearly $ in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year. corinthians - or the london-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez. it is particularly strange as - until last week - tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil where the argentine championship is not shown. presumably there is some financial logic behind the move. what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north rather than across the atlantic. argentina s brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal. but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez. boca re-signed martin palermo forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role. and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report - atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be disorganized. hounded by the press tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires. so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of tranquillity. anyone acquainted with the city of s& paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration. brazil s biggest city is a sprawling ugly restless metropolis. once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of a city of italian immigrants. but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers. the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians. it is the most passionately supported club in brazil. pel& scored reams of goals against them reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own. that passion can also be turned against the team - especially nowadays when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazil s big cities. corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players. tevez then can kiss tranquillity goodbye. he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores south america s champions league. corinthians have not qualified. indeed he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match. next year s brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april. until then he will have to make do with the foolish s& paulo state championship an appalling waste of his talent. there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina. like so many of the top south american players tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left to pass when he was expected to dribble to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares. but his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all.
859,finding new homes for old phones re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment it has social benefits too. research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. the forum for the future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. but the forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites. the report reveals that approximately million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk. of the million that are swapped for newer models each year only % get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. the slowly growing mass of unrecycled discarded phones has now reached million handsets the equivalent of tonnes of waste estimates james goodman report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future. it s quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around said mr goodman. many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world said mr goodman. far better he said to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life. we ve heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back said mr goodman but there s a strong social argument too. older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. the forum for the future report took an in-depth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular. it s an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network said mr goodman and there s a real desire for people to get mobile phones. but the relatively low wages in romania which is one of the poorest countries in europe mean few people can afford a shiny new phone. the affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one he said. reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. the re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset. georgeta minciu a romanian part-time cleaner said: normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. i am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me. this is the only way i can afford to have a phone she said. mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain s mobile mountain made it overseas. but he added those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset. if its more than a few years old people are not going to want it he said.
605,parry firm over gerrard listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from gmt. but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future. he told bbc five live: steven is above money. he is the future of liverpool. it doesn t matter if it s £ £ or £ we will not accept offers. but we are also realistic enough to know we can t keep steven against his will. on the subject of liverpool s finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium. and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan. parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july from a similar role at the premier league. there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield - and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard. on the subject of liverpool s captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes. he said: they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same - steven is not for sale. but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said: i sincerely hope he will be. steven knows my views. he knows rafa s views. we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him. we crave success as much as he does. we know he s ambitious and nobody can argue with that. i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he d like to do anything else. we all want to see progress by next season. he s not alone in that. there are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim. it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a £-plus bid in the summer - but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. there have been a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths. it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. we didn t had an offer last summer parry explained. we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn t want to sell him. in reality it didn t go beyond that. maybe there will be an offer in the summer. maybe there won t. our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will. that just doesn t work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way we ve decided to sell you is not on the agenda. you can forget that. parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool s new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in . and he confessed arsenal s £ deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the anfield club serious food for thought. he said: i have to say historically it is something i have been against and i have been on record as saying that but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye-opener. i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn t even been worth contemplating. but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow - that s interesting. my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium. some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but parry countered: i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell. i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to. that s not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but i think it is clearly something we have to explore. on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east. that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained: steve has never been used as a stalking horse. there s no need and that is not the way we do business. we had discussions with steve over the course of . i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn t happen. quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it. we are still evaluating it. steve s interest was taken very much on its own merits. his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isn t closed on anything. we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year. we have a common interest in making liverpool successful. that s a dream we all share so as far as i m concerned the door is not closed. i would take £ if we had no investment but if we did keep him. as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really £ for gerrard i don t care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard s quality. through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do. critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard. ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. i am hoping he doesn t walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash. £ realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it. i would however be happy with gerrard s transfer for any fee over £. parry s statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. upping the ante is another smart move by parry. i would keep gerrard. no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed. the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. clearly if he isn t then we would be foolish not to sell. the worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football.

364,bangkok film festival battles on organisers of the third bangkok international film festival have been determined to carry on with this year s event despite the ravages of the asian tsunami disaster. the festivities have been scaled down red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund. apart from this however the festival has continued as originally planned. when the disaster happened we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel said the festival s executive director craig prater. the decision was made that we would continue but that the focus would change. our premieres became fundraisers the opening night was visibly toned down and % of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund he continued. but we feel like we ve turned a page. we ve acknowledged our position and now it s business as usual. mr prater s sentiments were echoed by christine rush director of the festival s sister event the bangkok film market. we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nation s recovery from this terrible disaster she said. however the nation s recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life. we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out she added. given the conspicuously low audience figures that support may be more symbolic than significant. however poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties. the eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles including such oscar hopefuls as ray charles biopic ray and mike leigh s abortion drama vera drake. that said the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers. on a more positive note the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city. problems securing air transport the clash with last sunday s golden globes ceremony in los angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel. but the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher alongside such screen stars as michael douglas jeremy irons and jean-claude van damme. irons whose film being julia is in competition for the festival s golden kinnaree awards said he had wondered whether he should attend after december s catastrophe. i questioned whether i should come when such a tragedy had happened the british actor said. i thought it might be in rather bad taste. but then i spoke to the organisers and i was encouraged to let life go on. now i ve come here i m very glad. what impresses me about thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the west he continued. basically i was invited here by thailand. if they still want you to come you should. now in its third year bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. and while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in hong kong tokyo and pusan in south korea mr prater predicts it will soon become their equal. it s grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast he concedes. we ve had some bumps in the road but that s only because the festival is still a baby. i have no doubt in my mind that in five years this will be the top asian film festival in the world. the golden kinnarees will be awarded on friday. the festival itself runs until january.
824,prime minister s questions so who if anyone is playing politics with the security of the nation michael howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who he claims is ramming through parliament the controversial new anti-terror measures without proper debate. he didn t say so but the tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election and they believe tony blair is using the issue to suggest the tories are soft on terrorism. why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the tories offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws he demanded. the prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament. is not the opposition against to the proposed laws in principle in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless what this is really about believes mr blair is the tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass maybe even defeat the government. and that is more important to them than national security. liberal democrat leader charles kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue. he preferred to state that as with other issues like id cards the government s immediate instinct was authoritarian. as is his habit nowadays the prime minister was less rough with mr kennedy than he had been with mr howard - he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the lib dems have once again just missed the point. apart from all that it was electioneering as usual. the very first question to the prime minister from derby north s bob laxton asked him in effect if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools. later birmingham s sion simon even went so far as to suggest the tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now. the prime minister almost blushed. this was not the appropriate place to announce election day he stammered. but can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away - an announcement coming in the week beginning april for an election on may is where the big money is in the commons. and perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment.
1023,radcliffe tackles marathon tasks paula radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new york city marathon on sunday. back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics where she failed to finish the marathon and then the . bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race. the ability to run a gruelling . miles relies largely upon an athlete s belief that they can do it. every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it are you strong enough to finish the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. sports psychologist hugh richards says the -year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. there is an old adage get straight back on the horse that threw you richards told bbc sport. paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens. she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment. for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york - win or lose. if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. but if she fails to triumph she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues. athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions explains richards who has worked with past olympians. she must not get caught up in someone else s agenda. radcliffe s best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the -year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york. she just thought well they can t think any worse of me now yelling told bbc sport. she s just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it. radcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as impulsive but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets such as redemption. you can t change history warned richards. only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race. the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs final reserves. radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just days after the athens marathon. it s suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again said yelling herself a marathon runner. but that is only for long-term health and fitness. when you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. so physically it is possible for paula. richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to a strong physical display from radcliffe. the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens he said. and that just isn t going to be there in new york that s been taken out of the equation. radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in athens in time. and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage starting in new york. how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not argues richards. one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities. and yelling says: i think this will probably make paula. i think it will drive her on and she ll come out of it a better athlete.
1767,downing injury mars uefa victory middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren hopes that stewart downing did not seriously damage his hamstring during the - uefa cup win over graz ak. the winger was carried off on a stretcher in the closing stages as boro booked their place in the last . mcclaren said: stewart has tweaked a hamstring which is a blow for us. we will assess it in the morning. but i m delighted with the match result. they say in sport you can win ugly - and we certainly did. mcclaren was relieved to make it through after a tough encounter at the riverside. to be fair to graz they had a gameplan - they knocked the ball forward especially in the first half and we struggled to deal with it. in the second half we were better but it was frustrating because we got the goal - but one slip and they were back in it. boro face sporting lisbon for a place in the quarter-finals after the portuguese side saw off feyenoord on thursday. and mcclaren added: sporting are technically very good - portuguese sides always are. but the journey goes on for us and we will now go to their magnificent stadium - after the first game here - we ll look forward to it. goalscorer jimmy floyd hasselbaink added: it wasn t a particularly beautiful match to watch - but they made it difficult for us. we didn t play well at all. but you need a little bit of luck and i think we got that when my shot went through the legs of their goalkeeper. i would have liked to play in holland - that would have been a little bit special to me. but so is going back to portugal - i ll be playing against some lads i played with at boavista.
1356,jansen suffers a further setback blackburn striker matt jansen faces three weeks out after surgery to treat a cartilage problem. but central defender lorenzo amoruso is moving closer to fitness following a knee operation. rovers assistant manager mark bowen said: matt had a small operation to trim knee cartilage. it s a tiny piece of work which should be a fairly quick recovery. lorenzo is also jogging for the first time along with kicking a ball. jansen s career has been dogged by injury since a freak scooter accident two years ago. he returned to first-team action soon after mark hughes appointment as blackburn boss and marked it with a goal against portsmouth in his first appearance of the season. bowen added: i m guessing but i reckon maybe two to three weeks before he is back in action completely. the rovers assistant boss forecast a longer time spell for amoruso s availability for first-team duties. bowen said: there s still some scar tissue present so it will be some weeks. it s a case of see how he goes. you can t put a real time on a comeback we ll see how he progresses.
503,greek duo cleared in doping case sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal. the duo had been provisionally suspended by the iaaf for allegedly missing three drugs tests including one on the eve of the athens olympics. but the greek athletics federation tribunal has overturned the bans - a decision which the iaaf can now contest at the court of arbitration for sport. the pair s former coach christos tzekos has been banned for four years. kenteris and thanou had been charged with avoiding drug tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics. they withdrew from the olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on august. the pair then spent four days in a hospital claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. it was the international olympic committee s demand that the iaaf investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the greek tribunal. the head of that tribunal kostas panagopoulos said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in athens. the charge cannot be substantiated he said. in no way was he (kenteris) informed to appear for a doping test. the same goes for thanou. kenteris s lawyer gregory ioannidis said: the decision means mr kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career. he has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in january. this evidence shows mr kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the international olympic committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one. it shows he has no case to answer. mr kenteris should now be given the opportunity he deserves to rebuild his career in the full knowledge that there is no stain on his character. he has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures. but the iaaf said it was very surprised by the verdict. spokesman nick davies said: we note the decision of the greek authorities with interest. our doping review board will now consider the english version of the decision.

2129,strong dollar call halts slide the us dollar s slide against the euro and yen has halted after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was in america s interest . but analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the us economy were still significant. they also pointed out that positive comments apart president george w bush s administration had done little to stop the dollar s slide. a weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. the dollar was trading at $. against the euro at still close to the $. record level set on november. against the japanese yen it was trading at . yen after hitting a seven-month low of . earlier in the day. policy makers in europe have called the dollar s slide brutal and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. however it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro s rise at a monthly meeting of eurozone ministers late on monday. higher growth in europe is regarded by us officials as a way the huge us current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. mr snow who is currently in dublin at the start of a four-nation eu visit has applauded ireland s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth. the eurozone is growing below its potential. when a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners he said. mr snow s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on monday but he was careful to qualify his statement. our basic policy of course is to let open competitive markets set the values he explained. markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals. us officials have also said that other economies need to grow so the us is not the main global growth engine. economists say that the fundamentals or key indicators of the us economy are looking far from rosy. domestic consumer demand is cooling and heavy spending by president bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $ (£). the current account deficit meanwhile hit a record $ in the second quarter of . for many analysts a weaker dollar is here to stay. no end is in sight said carsten fritsch a strategist at commerzbank . it is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $.. some analysts maintain the us is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in europe thus boosting its economy.
1312,protect whistleblowers tuc says the government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces the tuc has said. it said data from employment tribunals suggested safety whistleblowers had lost their jobs since . some firms found it cheaper to sack a worker than to improve buildings or change working conditions it said. the health and safety executive said it was trying to get workers more involved in helping to make workplaces safer. the tuc figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue. safety representatives were often ignored when raising concerns because there was no legal duty to respond claimed the union organisation. general secretary brendan barber said: it shouldn t be a firing offence to object to unsafe work. workers should not be placed in the situation where they are forced to choose between risking their job or risking their personal health and safety. mr barber who said the problem is far worse than official statistics show called for a legal system that protects safety whistleblowers . he added that workers who are not in a union as well as casual and migrant workers stand little chance of redress. rory o neill editor of union-backed hazards magazine which conducted the research said: giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate win-win. death and injuries at work increased last year for the second time since the turn of the century. it would be a fatal mistake not to take full advantage of the union safety effect. the tuc has called on the government to appoint roving safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections. the health and safety executive had said that it had launched an initiative to make factories and offices safer with more worker involvement.

2111,warning over windows word files writing a microsoft word document can be a dangerous business according to document security firm workshare. up to % of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed a survey by the firm revealed. to make matters worse % of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking. the report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding. sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers said andrew pearson european boss of workshare which commissioned the research. the efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too he said. the problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using microsoft word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes. as documents get passed around worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents. poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits. microsoft however does provide an add-on tool for windows pcs that fixes the problem. the remove hidden data add-in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your microsoft office application says the instructions on microsoft s website. microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any word document. a tool for apple machines running word is not available. workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that on average % of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category. often said mr pearson this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared. however the way that windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved. few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed. the discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if for instance those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated. the research revealed that a document s metadata could be substantial as on average only % of contributors changes to a document make it to the final draft. problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite said mr pearson.

127,benitez deflects blame from dudek liverpool manager rafael benitez has refused to point the finger of blame at goalkeeper jerzy dudek after portsmouth claimed a draw at anfield. dudek fumbled a cross before lomana lualua headed home an injury-time equaliser levelling after steven gerrard put liverpool ahead. benitez said: it was difficult for jerzy. it was an unlucky moment. he was expecting a cross from matthew taylor and it ended up like a shot so i don t blame him for what happened. benitez admitted it was a costly loss of two points by liverpool who followed up their derby defeat against everton with a disappointing draw. he said: we had many opportunities but didn t score and in the end a - lead was not enough. if you don t have any chances you have to think of other things but when you are creating so many chances as we are there is nothing you can say to the players. it was a pity. we lost two points but we have one more point in the table. now we have another difficult game against newcastle and we have to recover quickly from that.
41,federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic. top seed federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed - in the first set. but ljubicic who beat tim henman in the last eight dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool though turning on the style to win the deciding set -. the match was a re-run of last week s final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam where federer triumphed but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets. i really wanted to get off to a good start this time and i did and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm federer said. that took me all the way through to - - - on his serve and i almost ran away with it. but he came back and that was a good effort on his side. ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set. i didn t start badly but then suddenly i felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. and with roger if you relax for a second it just goes very quick he said. after those first three games it was no match at all. i don t know it was really weird. i was playing really well the whole year and then suddenly i found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court. but despite his defeat the world number was pleased with his overall performance. i had a chance in the third and for me it s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match. it s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that i m up there and belong with top-class players.
2070,electronics firms eye plasma deal consumer electronics giants hitachi and matshushita electric are joining forces to share and develop technology for flat screen televisions. the tie-up comes as the world s top producers are having to contend with falling prices and intense competition. the two japanese companies will collaborate in research & development production marketing and licensing. they said the agreement would enable the two companies to expand the plasma display tv market globally. plasma display panels are used for large thin tvs which are replacing old-style televisions. the display market for high-definition televisions is split between models using plasma display panels and others - manufactured by the likes of sony and samsung - using liquid-crystal displays (lcds). the deal will enable hitachi and matsushita which makes panasonic brand products to develop new technology and improve their competitiveness. hitachi recently announced a deal to buy plasma display technology from rival fujitsu in an effort to strengthen its presence in the market. separately fujitsu announced on monday that it is quitting the lcd panel market by transferring its operations in the area to japanese manufacturer sharp. sharp will inherit staff manufacturing facilities and intellectual property from fujitsu. the plasma panel market has seen rapid consolidation in recent months as the price of consumer electronic goods and components has fallen. samsung electronics and sony are among other companies working together to reduce costs and speed up new product development.
1057,yukos loses us bankruptcy battle a judge has dismissed an attempt by russian oil giant yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the us. yukos filed for chapter protection in houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its yugansk division by the russian authorities. the court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of yugansk which yukos claims was illegally sold. separately former yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky began testimony on friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion. mr khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities. i pride myself on heading for years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees he told a russian court. yugansk was auctioned to help pay off $. (£.) in unpaid taxes. it was bought for $. by a previously-unknown group which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company rosneft. texas judge letitia clark said yukos did not have enough of a us presence to establish us jurisdiction. the vast majority of the business and financial activities of yukos continue to occur in russia judge clark said in her ruling. such activities require the continued participation of the russian government. yukos had argued that a us court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its yugansk unit was sold since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer bruce misamore lives in houston. yukos claimed it sought help in the us because other forums - russian courts and the european court of human rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the us courts. in her ruling the judge acknowledged that it appears likely that agencies of the russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under united states law . but she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction. the us court s jurisdiction had been challenged by deutsche bank and gazpromneft a former unit of russian gas monopoly gazprom which is due to merge with rosneft. analysts said the ability of gazprom and rosneft to trade freely overseas had been stifled while the ownership of yugansk remained unclear. yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling. however it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues. we believe the merits of our case are strong and simple said chief executive steven theede. our assets were illegally seized. we want them back or damages paid.
1214,toxic web links help virus spread virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares. a windows virus called bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code. those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus. the trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti-virus software that combs through code contained in e-mail attachments. the virus that uses this trick is called bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on november. they exploit a windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier. like many other recent viruses bofra plunders the address book in microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses. the virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but unlike many other recent viruses does not itself travel via mail. instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that when clicked on connect back to the machine that distributed that e-mail. essentially bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus. the messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a paypal transaction. copies of the messages seen by the bbc news website had bright yellow and green backgrounds. those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to. filtering firm clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down. in the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines. shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading. clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread. finnish anti-virus firm f-secure said that so far it had not seen many copies of the bofra virus and its variants in circulation. tim warner spokesman for anti-virus firm finjan said: you have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating. mr warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code. most firms have secured their e-mail gateway said mr warner but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways. he said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims. the bofra family of viruses which were originally thought to be offshoots of the mydoom bug can infect machines running windows me nt xp and server . users running windows xp that have applied the update are not vulnerable to the loophole that bofra exploits.
1021,format wars could confuse users technology firms sony philips matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video. the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different and conflicting content control systems experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy. currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device independent of how they originally obtained that content . the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music movies and other digital content they have bought. called the marlin joint development association the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium. the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft. confusingly for consumers the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple. in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats such as betamax and vhs that consumers have seen in the past said ian fogg personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research. the difference is that it is very fragmented he said. it s not a two-horse race it s a five six seven or even eight-horse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families. although initiatives such as microsoft s plays for sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty he said life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come. shelley taylor analyst and author of a report about online music services said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. apple s itunes service was a perfect example of this she said. although itunes has been hugely successful apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods she said. she said rampant competition between online music services of which there are now according to recent figures could drive more openness and freer file formats. it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run she said and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest. ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. people want portability she said and with peer-to-peer they have % portability. cory doctorow european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims. not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying he said. he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. instead said mr doctorow drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version the auto version the american and uk version the ringtone version and so on.
1185,rich pickings for hi-tech thieves viruses trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change. the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash steal valuable data or take over home pcs. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code. the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package. you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to said pete simpson head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift. now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. it s about outright criminality now said mr simpson explaining why this change has come about. he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. former virus writer marek strihavka aka benny from the virus writing group recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers phishing gangs and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. not least said paul king principal security consultant at cisco because the defences against such attacks are so common. in many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now he said. few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. if you think of criminals they do not do clever said mr king they just do what works. as the tactics used by malicious programs change said mr king so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network. many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. as well as using different tactics criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. the main motivation now is money said gary stowell spokesman for st bernard software. mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. with almost any phishing or spyware attack criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. so-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.
265,davenport hits out at wimbledon world number one lindsay davenport has criticised wimbledon over the issue of equal prize money for women. reacting to a disputed comment by all england club chairman tim phillips the american said: i think it is highly insulting if prize money is taken away. somebody i think it was mr phillips said they won t have money for flowers at wimbledon. that s insulting. an all england club spokesperson denied phillips made the remark insisting: he definitely didn t say it. the statement added: it was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the wimbledon grounds. davenport was speaking following the announcement that this week s dubai duty free event will join the us and australian opens in offering equal prize money for women. you hear about women playing only three sets while men play five said daveport. and the best women are never going to beat the best men. but it s a different game you go to watch with the women - it doesn t make it better or worse. hopefully we will be able to change people s minds. serena williams who is also in dubai added: i m obviously for equal prize money. women s tennis is exciting. men s tennis is exciting as well but the women have it right now. if you are bringing in the spectators you should be able to reap what everyone else is able to reap.
1285,police probe bnp mosque leaflet police are investigating a british national party leaflet posted to homes in south wales opposing plans for a new mosque. anti-racism campaigners in swansea have handed copies to south wales police. swansea s muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former st andrews united reform church. the building on george street has been derelict since the . taha idris director of the swansea bay race equality council said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public. i m quite shocked to see this sort of leaflet by the bnp in swansea he said. the bnp has tried in the past to get into swansea and this is another example of them trying again. i am in no doubt that the bnp are not needed and not wanted here. a south wales police spokeswoman confirmed that they were looking at the contents of the leaflet. according to the bnp s website they have been posted to homes in the castle ward. the bnp website carries a photograph of party leader nick griffin - who lives near welshpool mid wales - delivering the leaflet. the bnp has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest. swansea unite against fascism (uaf) is meeting this week to plan a campaign. following the death earlier this year of kalan kawa karim an iraqi kurd living in swansea it organised an anti-racism march in the city that was supported by more than people. it is planning its own mail shot campaign and may launch a petition in support of the plans for the mosque. andy richards of swansea uaf said the leaflet was exactly what he had come to expect from the bnp. the people of swansea will not put up with this. swansea s muslim community bought the former church just across the road from the existing mosque on st helen s road in the late . mr idris said the community was now raising money to renovate the building. it is a landmark building in swansea and would otherwise just crumble he said. it is the ideal opportunity for the building to be restored and used in the proper manner. it will be a muslim community centre. it s a holistic place used for education weddings deaths and births. he said space was limited in the current mosque and on some occasions muslims had to travel to llanelli for cultural events.
1781,game firm holds cast auditions video game firm bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games. the company which makes role playing games such as knights of the old republic and neverwinter nights is seeking people aged to . the canada-based company says it was looking for a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters . everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performer s fee for the use of their image. the company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in west edmonton alberta on friday and saturday bringing along a piece of photo identification. there are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical bioware game said shauna perry bioware s audio and external resources producer. those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people people with interesting faces. she added: not everyone is a model in the world so we don t want just models in our games. people chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. hundreds of photos of the person s head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in . the model will look exactly like the person - it s really quite incredible how detailed they are said ms perry. she said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. we cannot give people any control over how the images are used. but their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.
461,poppins musical gets flying start the stage adaptation of children s film mary poppins has had its opening night in london s west end. sir cameron mackintosh s lavish production which has cost £ to bring to the stage was given a -minute standing ovation. lead actress laura michelle kelly soared over the heads of the audience holding the nanny s trademark umbrella. technical hitches had prevented mary poppins flight into the auditorium during preview performances. a number of celebrities turned out for the musical s premiere including actress barbara windsor comic graham norton and sir richard attenborough. the show s director richard eyre issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven while under-threes are barred. mary poppins was originally created by author pamela travers who is said to have cried when she saw disney s film starring julie andrews. travers had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite. theatre impresario sir cameron mackintosh has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book.
1959,strong demand triggers oil rally crude oil prices surged back above the $ a barrel mark on thursday after an energy market watchdog raised its forecasts for global demand. the international energy agency (iea) warned demand for opec s crude in the first quarter would outstrip supply. the iea raised its estimate of oil demand growth by barrels a day to million barrels a day. us light crude rose $. to $. while brent crude in london gained $. to $.. the paris-based iea watchdog which advises industrialized nations on energy policy said the upward revision was due to stronger demand from china and other asian countries. the fresh rally in crude prices followed gains on wednesday which were triggered by large falls in us crude supplies following a cold spell in north america in january. the us department of energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen barrels to .. on top of that ongoing problems for beleaguered russian oil giant yukos have also prompted the iea to revise its output estimates from russia - a major non-opec supplier. i think that prices are now beginning to set a new range and it looks like the $ to $ level said energy analyst orin middleton of barclays capital.
264,tough rules for ringtone sellers firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks. the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones. in the last couple of years ringtones wallpapers screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers said jeremy flynn head of third party services at vodafone. if you are not on the operator s portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it s a problem of how people discover your services he said. to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them for instance several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of . websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently said mr flynn. people did not know they were being offered a subscription service. we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here he added. the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk s phone firms. everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct said andrew bud regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox. it s all about transparency he said. consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it. the consumer has a right to be protected he said. christian harris partnership manager of mobile content firm zed said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that s done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out he said. the new rules came in to force on january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for said mr flynn. also said mr flynn vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. we have quite draconian contracts with firms he said. we do not have to say why. we can just cut them off. under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal stop command sent via text message. he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality said mr flynn.
1698,chip maker backs net phone calls rich templeton the head of giant chip maker texas instruments has given his backing to the growing sector of voice over internet telephony (voip) voip allows pc users and in some cases those with just a broadband connection to make telephone calls via the net. mr templeton said voip would be the next major application to drive broadband connections into homes. internet service provider wanadoo has announced it is launching its own broadband telephony service in the uk. subscribers to wanadoo s broadband service will be able to use the service to make free evening and weekend calls to any uk landline and free calls at any time to other wanadoo users. the service will cost an extra £ a month and will come with a free livebox the broadband hub which wanadoo plans will be used in future to provide video-on-demand and home security services. the secondary phone line will mean customers can have an extra home phone number and will also provide wireless internet access around the home. eventually the service will replace existing landline services as wanadoo goes head to head with bt. voice-over broadband is a key trend across europe and is set to have a dramatic impact on the telecommunications industry eric abensur wanadoo s chief executive told the bbc news website. mr templeton said he agreed. voice-over-packet is going to be the second killer application after broadband internet access he said. the world s largest maker of chips for mobile phones believes the technology will grow rapidly from the relatively small user base it has currently. almost million people have downloaded the software that powers the skype voip service according to the net telephony firm s website. skype lets people make free calls to other skype users and also make low-cost calls to ordinary phone numbers. us firm vonage also offers a voip service but one which lets people plug an ordinary phone into a broadband router to make calls. bill simmelink general manager of ti s voip business said the technology would only take off when people were making net calls with the ease of making a normal call. it s not about the pipe if you will or the silicon per se it s about the application he said. we want to communicate freely effortlessly and economically wherever we are. in a sign that voip is seeping into the mainstream giant isp aol announced on tuesday that it had plans to launch a net-based phone service for some of its members within the month. customers will continue to use their traditional phones but they will plug them into adapters connected to their broadband source rather than the jack provided by the telephone company. calls are received and placed just like on the old telephone network. we can help mass-market adoption of voip said aol chief executive jonathan miller. we can utilise our national footprint. we can help the entire industry become well known.

1734,disney backs sony dvd technology a next generation dvd technology backed by sony has received a major boost. film giant disney says it will produce its future dvds using sony s blu-ray disc technology but has not ruled out a rival format developed by toshiba. the two competing dvd formats blu-ray developed by sony and others and toshiba s hd-dvd have been courting top film studios for several months. the next generation of dvds promise very high quality pictures and sound as well as a lot of data. both technologies use a blue laser to write information. it has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the betamax versus vhs war. sony lost out to jvc in that fight. the current battle for hollywood s hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. last month paramount universal and warner brothers said they were opting for the toshiba and nec-backed format hd-dvd high-definition discs. those studios currently produce about % of dvd content. sony pictures entertainment and mgm studios have already staked their allegiance with the blu-ray disc association whose members also include technology companies dell samsung and matsushita. twentieth century fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. if fox decided to go with blu-ray too it would mean the format would have a % share of dvd content. disney said its films would be available on the blu-ray format when dvd players for the standard went on sale on north america and japan expected in . universal is to start producing films on the hd-dvd format in and paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in . toshiba expects sales of hd-dvds to reach yen ($. £.) by .
1309,owen determined to stay in madrid england forward michael owen has told the bbc he is happy in spain and has no plans to quit real madrid to return to the premiership in the near future. but the -year-old who has spent much of his time coming off the bench in la liga did not rule out a return to the premiership at some stage. i m pleased with the start i ve made here he told bbc radio five live. england is my country. it s definitely part of me but who knows whether if or when i ll be playing there again. owen who moved to the bernabeu from liverpool last summer has grabbed goals for real but has been unable to replace raul or ronaldo in the starting line-up. however he said he was delighted with the way his time in spain was going and dismissed criticism of his decision to join real. when i first came there was a lot of scepticism back in england any maybe some out here he said. people were saying fourth-choice striker what are you going there for you ll be sat on the bench all the time . but as much as our press like to build it up as if i ve permanently had my backside on the bench i ve played as many games as anyone else in the team this year. for a fourth-choice striker at the start i m more than happy with the way i ve settled in. recent speculation has linked owen with a move back to england with newcastle expressing their interest but the england striker said he is not ready to return home. he added: i ve got nothing against the premiership i mean that s where i first performed that s where i made my name. i can t keep my eyes off the premiership on television when i m at home. when asked if it would have to be liverpool if he returned owen said: i ve not really given it much thought. i ve got great memories of liverpool. no matter what happens it ll always be a club i have fond memories of and it will always have a place in my heart. it s very flattering to be linked to top clubs in england - i m glad that no-one is forgetting me! but i couldn t have wished for a better start in madrid. - listen to the full interview with garry richardson on bbc radio five live s sportsweek at gmt on sunday.
1039,campaigners attack mtv sleaze mtv has been criticised for incessant sleaze by television indecency campaigners in the us. the parents television council (ptc) which monitors violence and sex on tv said the cable music channel offered the cheapest form of programming. the group is at the forefront of a vociferous campaign to clean up american television. but a spokeswoman for mtv said it was unfair and inaccurate to single out mtv for criticism. the ptc monitored mtv s output for hours from march to march during the channel s spring break coverage. in its report - mtv smut peddlers: targeting kids with sex drugs and alcohol - the ptc said it witnessed flashes of nudity or sexual situations and verbal references to sex. brent bozell ptc president and conservative activist said: mtv is blatantly selling raunchy sex to kids. compared to broadcast television programmes aimed at adults mtv s programming contains substantially more sex foul language and violence - and mtv s shows are aimed at children as young as . there s no question that tv influences the attitudes and perceptions of young viewers and mtv is deliberately marketing its raunch to millions of innocent children. the watchdog decided to look at mtv s programmes after janet jackson s infamous wardrobe malfunction at last year s super bowl. the breast-baring incident generated complaints and cbs - which is owned by the same parent company as mtv - was quick to apologise. mtv spokeswoman jeannie kedas said the network follows the same standards as broadcasters and reflects the culture and what its viewers are interested in. it s unfair and inaccurate to paint mtv with that brush of irresponsibility she said. we think it s underestimating young people s intellect and level of sophistication. ms kedas also highlighted the fact mtv won an award in for the fight for your rights series that focused on issues such as sexual health and tolerance.

624,games enter the classroom video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom. with violent titles continuing to top the charts gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn. recent research by the london institute of education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom. games teach life skills such as decision making problem solving said martin owen at futurelab. mr owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error. futurelab is a non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning. most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but liverpool-based games firm lateral visions saw a gap in the market. learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn t see anyone else doing what we wanted to do said dr carl gavin managing director of lateral visions. the company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element. the result is racing academy a massively multiplayer car racing game which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well. it is being used by futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom. we are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational said mr owen. players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach. the game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs before and after racing. teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data work collaboratively and review their own performances. this fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved thinks mr owen. the game has been trialled in two secondary schools in bristol and feedback from students has been positive. pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other said ben williamson a researcher at futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools. dr gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers need for learning outcomes and the children s desire to rise to a challenge. games in the classroom need to support the teacher. it is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge he said. professor angela macfarlane based at bristol university has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms. use of games in schools has been patchy she found with sim city proving the most popular. traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun she found in her research. it is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies she wrote in a paper entitled games and learning. lite versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market. this would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing. already there are games on the market such as civilisation and age of empire that have educational elements said mr owen. even in grand theft auto it is not just the violence that engages people he said. it could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though.
557,us bank boss hails genius smith us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has given a speech at a scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist adam smith. he delivered the adam smith lecture in kirkcaldy fife. the adam smith lecture celebrates the author of s wealth of nations which became a bible of capitalism. dr greenspan was invited by chancellor gordon brown whose minister father john used to preach at the st bryce kirk church. mr brown introduced dr greenspan to the invited guests as the the world s greatest economist . dr greenspan who has been in the uk to attend the meeting in london said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to smith whose genius he compared to that of mozart. he said the philosopher was a towering contributor to the modern world . kirkcaldy the birthplace in of adam smith and by extension of modern economics is also of course where your chancellor was reared. i am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor s renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area. he continued: smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics just then emerging worked. in so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living. dr greenspan said smith s revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world. the incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the enlightenment - especially with smith toiling in the environs of kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest he said. following his lecture dr greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the queen at balmoral in - was awarded an honorary fellowship of the royal society of edinburgh. he later opened an exhibition dedicated to smith in the atrium of fife college of further and higher education. joyce johnston principal of the college said: it is very fitting that the world s premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world s first economist. dr greenspan - who became chairman of the federal reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in june - will step down in january next year. he has served under presidents george w bush bill clinton george bush and ronald reagan. he was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to gerald ford.
1850,kennedy to make temple address charles kennedy is set to address people at a hindu temple as part of an appeal to ethnic minority voters. the liberal democrat leader will visit the shri swaminarayan mandir temple in neasden north west london. he will say labour can no longer lay exclusive claim to the votes of britain s ethnic minorities . mr kennedy will also highlight the anger among people of all races over the iraq war and call for a balanced approach to tackling terrorism. saturday s speech comes days after the lib dems launched their ethnic minority mini-manifesto. mr kennedy is to tell the audience: many people in britain of all races cultures and religions were angry about the way we were taken to war in iraq. and they saw the principled stand the liberal democrats took at the time. he will also say that the lib dems want to restore britain s reputation on the world stage by fighting international poverty and climate change and protecting human rights. mr kennedy will say that a balanced approach to tackling terrorism would mean tough measures to make britain safe - but not at the expense of people s fundamental legal rights like has happened at belmarsh . he will say it also means acting through the united nations on terrorism. mr kennedy held talks with tony blair on friday over government plans to hold terror suspects under house arrest. he said afterwards that the prime minister had offered some movement to address his concerns. the plans face trouble in the lords if conservative and lib dem opposition continues.
637,nintendo ds makes its euro debut nintendo s ds handheld game console has officially gone on sale in europe. many stores around the uk opened at midnight to let keen gamers get their hands on the device. the two-screen clamshell gadget costs £ ( euros) and games are available for it at launch some featuring well-known characters such as super mario and rayman. the ds spearheads nintendo s attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market. since going on sale in japan and the us at the end of nintendo has sold almost ds consoles. part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the ds can run any of the catalogue of games produced for nintendo s gameboy advance handheld. games for the ds are expected to cost between £ and £. about games for the ds are in development. as well as having two screens one of which is controlled by touch the ds also lets players take on up to other people via wireless. a download play option means ds owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns a copy of a particular game. other ds owners can also be sent text messages and drawings. nintendo is also planning to release a media adapter for the handheld so it can play music and video. five virgin megastores and game shops were expected to open early on friday morning to let people buy a ds. we know that customers want it as soon as it s released - and that means the minute not the day said robert quinn game s uk sales director. but nintendo will only have sole control of europe s handheld gaming market for a few weeks because soon sony is expected to release its psp console. although nintendo is aiming for younger players and the psp is more for older gamers it is likely that the two firms will be competing for many of the same customers. sony s psp represents a real threat to nintendo because of the huge number of playstation owners around the world and the greater flexibility of the sleek black gadget. the psp uses small discs for games can play music and movies without the need for add-ons and also supports short-range wireless play. when it goes on sale the psp is likely to cost between £ and £.
1763,mourinho to escape fa charge chelsea boss jose mourinho will not face any football association action over the comments he made after their carling cup tie with manchester united. mourinho intimated that united boss sir alex ferguson influenced referee neale barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half-time. but an fa spokesman told bbc sport: we are not taking action over mourinho. we have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required. that is the end of it. mourinho was concerned that ferguson s conversation with barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official. i see one referee in the first half and another in the second said mourinho. if the fa ask me what happened i will tell them. what i saw and felt made it easier to understand a few things. maybe when i turn and have been managing in the same league for years and have the respect of everybody i will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble a little bit. the referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free-kicks. it was fault after fault dive after dive. but i know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half-time. he should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him but there was also someone else. referees chief keith hackett believes mourinho should retract his comments about ferguson and barry as he believes the blues boss has questioned their integrity. i m hoping he might reconsider his comments unfortunately this is the nature of the game said hackett. i don t want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers. for the second leg we have an experienced referee and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing. sometimes managers have grounds for comments and i note that but a referees integrity has been questioned that is offensive and should be avoided. mr mourinho should look at the facts. mourinho added that the match was entertaining for a goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final. it s - so if we win we go through and if we get a draw we go to extra time he said. we have exactly the same chance we had before this game. we are confident of getting a result but we know what manchester united is a footballing power. it ll be difficult for us but also for them.

2085,mobile games come of age the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. a brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below. if you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. even before nokia s n-gage game phone launched in late many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset. and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market. that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders lunar lander and bejewelled. there are also versions of titles such as colin mcrae rally that you typically find on pcs and consoles. there are shoot-em-ups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost £. what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push. by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use graphics. the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them. a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth short-range radio technology. with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing. too fast too furious (digital bridges) as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games - because i m rubbish at them. no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. winning gives you cash for upgrades. graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play. fatal force (macrospace) a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth. graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. both background music and sounds effects work well. the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders. weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. with the right power-up you can go into a matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range. online the game has quite a following with clans player rankings and even new downloadable maps.
1841,plaid mp s cottage arson claim a plaid cymru mp believes uk security services were involved in some arson attacks blamed on welsh extremists. it is years since the start of years of fire-bombings attributed to a shadowy group known as meibion glyndwr. plaid cymru s elfyn llwyd has suggested the security services could have been involved with the intention of discrediting the nationalist vote. ex-welsh office minister lord roberts of conwy denied security services were involved. in march this year north wales police reopened the case saying materials kept during their investigations would be examined to find whether it would yield dna evidence. meibion glyndwr - which means sons of glyndwr - began burning property in december in protest at homes in rural wales being sold as holiday cottages to people from england. the group was linked to most of the or so fire-bombing incidents stretching from the llyn peninsula to pembrokeshire. the campaign continued until the early . police were accused in some quarters of targeting anyone who was a nationalist. although one man sion aubrey roberts was convicted in of sending letter bombs in the post the arson cases remain unsolved. as a solicitor elfyn llwyd represented welsh singer bryn f& when he was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the arson campaign. f& was released without charge . but now as mp for merionnydd nant conwy and plaid cymru s parliamentary leader mr llwyd has argued that some of the terror attacks may have had the involvement of the security services and not meibion glyndwr. he believes that elements of the british security services may have carried out renegade actions in order to discredit plaid cymru and the nationalist vote ahead of elections. the claim is made in an interview for bbc wales maniffesto programme to be shown on on sunday. mr llwyd said that the sophistication of many of the devices used in the attacks compared to the crude nature of many others suggests a degree of professionalism which could only have come from individuals who knew exactly what they were doing. he said: what i m saying is that the role that they took wasn t the appropriate one i.e. like an agent provocateur and perhaps interfering and creating a situation where it looked like it was the nationalists that were responsible. the programme also heard from lord roberts of conwy who was a welsh office minister at the time. he denied that the security services played any improper role. mr llwyd s theory has also been questioned by plaid cymru s former president dafydd wigley. he accepted that the fires damaged plaid cymru s public image but believed that the security services had their hands full at the time with the ira and animal rights activists. - maniffesto can be seen on on sunday december at gmt.

1117,tsunami slows sri lanka s growth sri lanka s president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $. (£.) by appealing for peace and national unity. president kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict. meanwhile the international monetary fund (imf) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from sri lanka s economic growth this year. it estimated the wave left physical damage equal to .% of the economy. separately the international labour organisation (ilo) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in sri lanka and indonesia alone. it called for action to create jobs. president kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of hambantota. she was joined by government and opposition politicians together with buddhist hindu muslim and christian clergy. prime minister mahinda rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide homes for survivors of the tsunami. mrs kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation . we are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. instead we have been squabbling fighting she added. norway s peace negotiator erik solheim is due to arrive on wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the tamil tigers who want a separate state in the north east of the country. reconstruction efforts in eastern sri lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides. the imf said that the sri lankan authorities initial estimates have put the physical damage at $. to $. but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this. the broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage the imf said. growth inflation the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs. the fishing industry has been devastated agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer especially in the short term the report said. the ilo estimated that sri lankans have lost their jobs mostly in these three industries. earnings from tourism this year are expected to be % lower than last year. economic growth this year is expected to be % which is about % less than previously forecast. inflation could climb to % compared to a previous estimate of %. although major exports have not suffered the imf expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. foreign exchange reserves may become strained as sri lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level which totalled more than two months worth of imports. last week the imf approved sri lanka s request for a freeze on loan repayments.
1802,souness eyes summer move for owen newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up a summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen. he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer who is due to retire in the summer although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on. michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and we re monitoring him he told bbc newcastle. he is a great centre-forward and only but i don t think we re the only ones monitoring the situation at real. souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season. he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburn s club scoring record may influence the striker s decision. milburn scored league and cup goals between and while shearer currently has goals to his name. without giving too much away i am confident he will be here next season said souness. i can t imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburn s scoring record. souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window. the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the phone-in for bbc newcastle souness said tried to re-sign him but villa were not interested in selling. the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed. i m after three four or five new players in the summer - we have got lots of targets he said. don t think we will wait to the last day of the season to say: `who are we going to target now

1300,milburn defends poster campaign labour s election chief alan milburn has defended his party s campaign posters amid tory claims the ads were nothing short of sly anti-semitism . mr milburn said he appreciated people s concerns but insisted that what they were was anti-tory and not in any way shape or form anti-semitic . he was responding to tory spokesman julian lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party. labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs. a row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict michael howard who is jewish as fagin and as a flying pig amid claims they were anti-semitic. the posters were labelled a big misjudgement by the conservatives who said labour s first shot in the election has badly backfired . the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members who were asked to vote on their favourite. labour has taken them off its website saying members preferred other posters. the party s four new designs launched on tuesday steer clear of the fagin or flying pig images but make clear that labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the tory leader personally with reminders of his record in office. the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. in the commons tory spokesman mr lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded mps that labour chairman ian mccartney last year described shadow chancellor oliver letwin as a century fagin . given the outrage that that smear caused then how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti-semitism mr milburn replied that they were not anti-semitic. what they were was anti-tory and i make no apologies at all for making clear to the british public exactly what the conservative plans would mean he said. i fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the labour party website. the fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off labour s website on monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin holding a blackboard reading +=. a labour spokesman later said their removal from the party s website was not affected by the row.
1477,giving financial gifts to children your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this christmas but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. it may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs for example. the government is trying to encourage saving at an early age through its new child trust fund. the first vouchers worth £ or £ for low-income families will be distributed from january. all children born after september will be eligible. parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in april . parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £ a year which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. as the child trust fund will not be in force in time for christmas relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children s deposit account and use this as a feeder fund. there are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the ladybird account from the saffron walden building society paying .% for a minimum balance of £ and the alliance & leicester firstsaver which pays .% also starting at £. interest earned by children is subject to income tax. however children like adults have a personal income tax allowance (£ for the current tax year). if the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. as long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance then no tax will be payable. when the account is opened a form available from the bank or building society should be completed. this confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax. the tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. only £ of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. where interest exceeds this level the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. this is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. therefore it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the child trust fund which is tax free with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £ limit being directed to a deposit account. another favourite solution is premium bonds. with the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account they make great presents. the parent or guardian will be responsible for the bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. any prizes will be sent to the parent or child s guardian. the minimum for each purchase is £ and bonds are sold in multiples of £. there are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored. over the longer term stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment although in the shorter term they can be volatile. one of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. one way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. these are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. these funds may be actively managed where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential or passive where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index for example the ftse . exchange traded funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. these are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). the difference is that the charges are quite low. the only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age and parents will have no control over how it is spent. for larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.

1204,at a glance: tory health checks the uk opposition conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the general election. here s a guide to the plan: people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. if they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. all people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical. tuberculosis hepatitis b and hiv. a positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. all other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis. people would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the uk or impose significant costs or demands on the nhs. they would also if appropriate have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for. people coming to britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care childcare or teaching. children and pregnant women wanting to live in britain permanently would not have to have a chest x-ray for tb. under would not face tests for hepatitis and hiv. the tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in britain because of poor health. however they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases. they claim government figures show that tb in england has increased by % over the last years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. they also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. they say the plans will protect access to the nhs. applicants will be tested in their home country. only asylum seekers will be tested in the uk once their refugee status is established. home office minister des browne says the government already routinely checks people for tb if they come into the uk for six months or more from high-risk countries. recent medical checks were carried out on people at heathrow airport and at gatwick. from those tests about infectious cases of tb were found. the tories say other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. the party has looked at the way the system is operated in australia canada and new zealand. the tory proposals are quite closely modelled on the new zealand system. labour claims the policy is little more than a desperate attempt to catch up with labour s five-year plan for immigration and asylum which was published last week. this says health screening for tb will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk. the liberal democrats have warned labour and the tories they were in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it .

1699,record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham. and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record. apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time. athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at in competition. mind you every time she breaks the record she gets $ so she can afford to be deliberate about it. world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evening s work for kelly holmes. she looked good and was very positive. agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the world s top three runners this season. yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly. my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasn t convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men s in madrid. he started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish. it would have been nice to see what mark lewis-francis could have done in the final if only he hadn t got himself disqualified. he was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. my view is you re meant to go when the gun goes and not before. and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. having said that mark is looking in much better shape. but i haven t seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests france s ronald pognon - who has run . seconds - will be under threat at the europeans. from a british point of view sarah claxton s victory in the hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet. something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the women s national race in a new personal best of . seconds. aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong squad going to the european championships. scotland s lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal. from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the but i don t think the pace-making was great. canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last year s shape she would have given defar a real run for her money. she had a go but just could not hang in there. we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the men s . but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape. as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti. but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season. it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.
1639,feta cheese battle reaches court a row over whether only greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the european court of justice. the danish and german governments are challenging a european commission ruling which said greece should have sole rights to use the name. the commission s decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to italian parma ham and french champagne. but critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term with the cheese produced widely outside greece. the commission s controversial ruling gave protected designation of origin status to feta cheese made in greece effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there. from onwards greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in europe must find another name to describe their products. the german and danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years. in our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese hans arne kristiansen a spokesman for the danish dairy board told the bbc. denmark is europe s second largest producer of feta after greece - producing about tonnes a year - and exports its products to greece. it is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in denmark such as brie. it would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation mr kristiansen said. that is just one of the costs. the case will also have a major impact on britain s sole feta producer yorkshire company shepherds purse cheeses. judy bell the company s founder said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product. if we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation she said. we have never tried to pull the wool over anyone s eyes - it s very clear from the label that it s yorkshire feta. the original decision was a victory for greece where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about years. feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat s milk and is an essential ingredient in greek cuisine. greece makes tonnes mainly for domestic consumption. the court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn.
236,kenyan school turns to handhelds at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus. they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. it is a pilot project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e-slates. the e-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. the data is transmitted alongside audio signals. the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e-slates. it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. it also stores this on its hard disc. the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. it s very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but it s also a one-way connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult. the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux-based system. the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions. users can scroll through these sections independently of each other. eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world s largest university libraries. all books in the public domain something like million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions. we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the e-slates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working. maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the e-slates says the project s ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting - as they need it most.
1205,housing plans criticised by mps irreversible environmental damage will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in south-east england mps have warned. sustainable communities were being promoted without a real understanding of what sustainable means the environmental audit committee said. it said issues like energy needs and transport were not properly addressed. deputy prime minister john prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced. he said: we are working across government especially with our colleagues at defra to create cleaner safer and greener communities while protecting and enhancing the environment. the report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues including water even though supplies in parts of the south east are already too low. regulations designed to ensure energy-efficient buildings are too lax and builders routinely flout them anyway it said. financing for improving transport was around one-twentieth of what would be required. the report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially john prescott s department bbc environment correspondent richard black said. chairman of the environmental audit committee peter ainsworth mp said: the government s housing policy is an alarming example of disjointed thinking in an areas where joined-up policy is crucial. i accept the need to improve housing supply but as things stand the principal beneficiary of housing growth will be property developers with the environment we all depend on being the principal loser. points raised in the report included: - no proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without strong supporting evidence. - the government should recognise shortcomings of the treasury s barker review which said new homes a year were needed in britain. - the government should consider a national spatial framework for england such as those already in place in scotland and wales. - the office of the deputy prime minister should maximise brown field development and housing densities. - measures to encourage improved energy efficiency for existing homes should be considered - including reduced stamp duty for homes that achieve set standards and a clear timetable for achieving zero-emissions homes. - the government should make clear how it intends to measure its success at creating sustainable communities. conservative local government spokeswoman caroline spelman said: there is now growing evidence that john prescott s buildings programme is environmentally unsustainable leaving a concrete scar across the face of rural england.
1516,falconer rebuts charade claims concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia through the back door were not a political ploy the lord chancellor has said. ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday. lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear. the bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves. ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards. critics fear it could allow killing by omission through withdrawing treatment including food and fluids. tony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill. but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland. it is important we don t end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen he said. on tuesday the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by votes to despite rebellion by labour mps. the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill. but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark. eventually he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes prompting claims of a shambles. the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been. lord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords. he told bbc news: we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life. the motive has got to be to end suffering. he denied the concessions were a political manoeuvre forced by panic about the rebellion. it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a sensible solution he said. i don t think it is something to be embarrassed about. these issues are not easy to deal with he went on. bbc political editor andrew marr said mr lammy was waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast after his performance. but lord falconer praised his minister for an excellent job . former conservative leader iain duncan smith one of the chief critics of the plans condemned the debate as a charade and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague.
19,games maker fights for survival one of britain s largest independent game makers argonaut games has been put up for sale. the london-based company behind the harry potter games has sacked about employees due to a severe cash crisis. the administrators told bbc news online that selling argonaut was the only way to save it as it had run out of cash. argonaut warned that it was low on cash days ago when its shares were suspended from trading on the london stock exchange. argonaut has been making games for some years and is one the largest independent games developers in the uk. along with its headquarters in north london it operates studios in cambridge and sheffield. argonaut was behind the harry potter games which provided a healthy flow of cash into the company. but like all software developers argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers. signs that it was in trouble emerged in august when it warned it was heading for losses of £ in the financial year due to delays in signing new contracts for games. those new deals were further delayed leading argonaut to warn in mid-october that it was running out of cash and suspend trading of its shares on the london stock exchange. as part of cost-cutting measures some employees were fired. when the news about the £ loss came out we knew there were going to be redundancies said jason parkinson one of the game developers sacked by argonaut. a lot of people suspected that argonaut had been in trouble for some time he told bbc news online. mr parkinson said staff were told the job losses were necessary to save argonaut from going under. at the start of the year the company employed people. after the latest round of cuts there are staff at argonaut headquarters in edgware in north london with at its morpheme offices in kentish town london and at the just add monsters base in cambridge. argonaut called in administrators david rubin & partners on friday to find a way to rescue the company from collapse. it spent the weekend going over the company s finances and concluded that the only way to save the business was to put it up for sale. the administrator told bbc news online that the costs of restructuing would be too high partly because of the overheads from the company s four premises across the uk. it said it was hopeful that it could save some jobs by selling the business saying it had had expressions of interest from several quarters and were looking for a quick sale. the administrator said it would ensure that staff made redundant would receive any wages redundancy or holiday pay due to them hopefully by christmas.

1416,web helps collect aid donations the web is helping aid agencies gather resources to help cope with the aftermath of the tsunami disaster. many people are making donations via websites or going online to see how they can get involved with aid efforts. high-profile web portals such as google yahoo ebay and amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations. so many were visiting some aid-related sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic. an umbrella organisation called the disasters emergency committee (dec) has been set up by a coalition of charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website. it urged people to go online where possible to help because donations could be processed more quickly than cash donated in other ways meaning aid could be delivered as quickly as possible. the site has so far received almost £ million with more than donations being made online every hour. telco bt stepped in to take over the secure payments on the dec site and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after it was initially crippled with online donations. it has also provided space in london s bt tower for one of the call centres dealing with donations. some of the web s biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying their homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources. on its famously sparse homepage google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made. among the organisations listed are oxfam medecins sans frontieres (doctors without borders) and network for good. many of the sites that google lists are also taking online donations. online retailer amazon has put a large message on its start page that lets people donate money directly to the american red cross that will be used with relief efforts. auction site ebay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on ebay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list. yahoo is proving links direct to charities for those that want to donate. the auction drop website is asking people to donate old digital cameras computers and other gadgets they no longer want that can be auction to raise cash for the aid effort. sadly the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in. anti-fraud organisations are warning about e-mails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies. those wanting to give cash were urged to use legitimate websites of charities and aid agencies.

515,india to deport bollywood actress india has ordered the deportation of iranian-born model and actress negar khan to norway after saying she was working illegally on her visa. khan has had raunchy roles in music videos and bollywood films over the past two years. the distressed actress told media she was being driven straight to the airport after a routine appointment at the bombay immigration office. immigration officials said she had been warned about her visa last year. khan told an indian news channel on her mobile phone: they are not even letting me go home to get my bags. i have no clothes or money on me. they did not give me any notice. i don t know why they are taking me away like this. there is nothing wrong with my visa. it says i work here... they are not allowing me to even call a lawyer. bipin bihari deputy police chief in bombay said khan was being sent back to norway from which she holds a passport on the first available flight. she was on a visitor s visa but she has engaged in several commercial ventures he said. we issued notices last year in view of which she had gone back to norway but she has returned again this year to work. one of khan s biggest successes was the steamy hindi song chadti jawani (rising youth). khan was involved in controversy when topless photos alleged to be of her appeared in a norwegian magazine.
1744,brown to outline presidency goals next year will be make or break for development in poorer countries gordon brown will say as he sets out uk goals for its eu and presidencies. the chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in . they will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. mr brown also wants other nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending .% of national income. he also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for aids and malaria. the chancellor is travelling to america next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. he told bbc radio s today programme: we need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health of illiteracy of poverty particularly in africa but right through the developing countries. his proposals were effectively a new marshall plan for the world including an international finance facility which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $ a year. agreement in the doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed he argued. the european union s common agricultural policy had caused aggravated trade problems he said but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies. mr brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. but with children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed including % debt relief multilaterally. that is why next year is a test he said. if after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results. the catholic aid agency cafod will host mr brown s speech on wednesday. cafod wants britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the us to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. mr brown said america too needed to take more action but defended president george bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. oxfam s paying the price report this week said million children will die needlessly before and aid budgets are half their levels. the charity s director barbara stocking said: offers the chance for an historic breakthrough but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure. the report said the of top industrialised nations had agreed in to spend .% of their incomes on aid. but years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. mr blair who has described africa as a scar on the world s conscience has already said tackling world poverty would be one his priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. but band aid founder bob geldof in july said he was sick of hearing guff about scars on the world. it was pathetic that britain was the richest country in the world but only the most generous aid donor he added. conservative shadow international development secretary alan duncan accused mr brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million africans by . instead only people would benefit he said. there s no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has added mr duncan.

(£) joint venture factory in china which would make it the first foreign cigarette maker to manufacture there. the state tobacco monopoly administration said a week later that it had not approved the deal leading to an embarrassing public row. bat told the bbc at that time that it had not negotiated with the stmc and secured approval from the highest levels of government . since then the row has flared occasionally most recently at a forum in november. bat consistently declines to comment. xing s statement comes as especially bad news for british american tobacco the china daily newspaper said of the latest development. the bat spokeswoman said: there is nothing for us to add...since our announcement in july last year. the central government of china is the authority that approved our strategic investment. the decision to ban further tobacco factories does not apply to deals made before according to the french news agency afp. the joint venture factory was expected to take till to build. the bat spokeswoman would not comment on its progress. however if the stma continues to take a tough stance expansion opportunities could be limited. china s tobacco market is increasingly valuable as anti-smoking campaigners target public smoking in the west. china daily said the market was currently enjoying steady growth making more than yuan ($.) in pre-tax profits last year almost double the figure in . the paper made no mention of health concerns. the stma is trying to restructure the domestic tobacco industry closing some factories though such moves can be unpopular with local governments.

1554,gadget market to grow in the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into delegates at the world s largest gadget show in las vegas have been told. the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by % while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important. everything is going digital kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association told the bbc news website. the consumer electronics show (ces) featured the pick of s products. consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs [high-definition tvs] digital radio and digital cameras will remain strong in . all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry. despite showing diversity some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much wow factor as in previous years. the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces which was the time and place shifting of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere at any time. at the start of last year s ces the cea predicted there would be an average growth of % in . that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players personal video recorders and digital cameras. it was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. part of this has been the rise in spending power of the generation x-ers who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. more than % of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers according to cea research. hybrid devices which combine a number of multimedia functions were also in evidence on the show floor. a lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it said stephen baker a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group. some of these functions cost next to nothing to add. as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable players to giant high-definition tvs several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders such as microsoft chief bill gates. despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate s pre-show speech he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the us market. he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. he disappointed some however by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console. another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony s new portable games device the psp had at the show. sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe. it went on sale in japan before christmas. there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their consumer technology offering. elsewhere at the show there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens including samsung s -inch (. metre) plasma - the largest in the world. industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in with new formats for dvds coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional dvds. with so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage like seagate s pocket sized external hard drive which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. more than trade professionals attended ces in las vegas which officially ran from to january.
1330,palestinian economy in decline despite a short-lived increase in palestinian jobs in the economy is performing well below its potential said a world bank report. unemployment stood at % compared with % before the uprising against israeli occupation four years ago. young people are particularly hard hit with % out of work compared with % four years ago. but new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures. however during the first half of this year the palestinian economy lost more than jobs. last year s growth rate of % can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence the report said. according to the report intifada closures and palestinian economic crisis: an assessment there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and palestinian economic problems. the closures arranged by israel restrict the movement of palestinian people and goods slowing down trade. closures are a key factor behind today s economic crisis in the west bank said nigel roberts world bank country director for the west bank and gaza. nearly half of all palestinians - some % - live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks. the report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $ a year from international donors some of which goes towards job creation. it also called on the palestinian authority to revive its reform programme and maintain financial discipline to create an investment-friendly climate. this week colin powell us secretary of state was visiting the west bank to stress us support for a smooth palestinian election in january.
1335,musicians upbeat about the net musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music a survey has found. the study by us researchers pew internet suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing. while most considered file-sharing as illegal many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders. even successful artists don t think the lawsuits will benefit musicians said report author mary madden. for part of the study pew internet conducted an online survey of musicians songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april . they ranged from full-time successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music. we looked at more of the independent musicians rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry ms madden told the bbc news website. we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented. the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood. almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration with nine out of going online to promote advertise and post their music on the web. more than % offered free samples online while two-thirds sold their music via the net. independent musicians in particular saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly. musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically said ms madden. they are using the internet to gain inspiration sell it online tracking royalties learning about copyright. perhaps surprisingly opinions about online file-sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry. through the recording industry association of america (riaa) it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music. but the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the us. it found that most artists saw file-sharing as both good and bad though most agreed that it should be illegal. free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing said one musician quoted by the report. it s hard to keep making records if they don t pay for themselves through sales. however % said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters. many suggested that rather than fighting file-sharing the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it. both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy said ms madden.

2202,local net tv takes off in austria an austrian village is testing technology that could represent the future of television. the people of engerwitzdorf are filming editing and producing their own regional news channel. the channel covers local politics sports events and anything that residents want to film and are prepared to upload for others to watch on pcs. the pilot has been so successful that telekom austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere. it s growing unbelievably fast said rudolf fischer head of telekom austria s fixed line division. the trial of buntes fernsehen (multi-coloured tv) was started in late and creates a net-based tv station run by the residents of engerwitzdorf. the hardware and software to turn video footage into edited programmes has been provided by telekom austria but this equipment following training has been turned over to the villagers. any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to a buntes fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch. most people watch the tv on their home pc and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes. in the first four months of the project villagers have created films and put together regular reports on local news items. they have adopted it very quickly said mr fischer. they like the possibility to create their own content and see what s going on in the area. it s kind of the democratisation of local tv he said because none of the bigger broadcasters would ever do anything like this for that region. the buntes fernsehen project has been such a success that telekom austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas. mr fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes. the engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of telekom austria s online tv channel aon which lets people watch programmes on their pc. aon streams a couple of live channels plus sports news and music programmes on to the net and has a pay-for-download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it. in october a larger tv-on-demand project is due to launch in vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net.
1917,tory leader unveils spending plan tory leader michael howard says his party can save £ in government spending by tackling waste. the money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes. the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps robert jackson a former minister to labour. mr howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election. let s be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what mr jackson did he told bbc s breakfast with frost programme. however the defection on saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the conservatives spending plans. fuller details are due to be unveiled on monday. the bulk of the £ saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services mr howard said. the £ left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing he added. however the remainder would deal with some of the unfair taxes . almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes mr howard insisted. because borrowing is going up it is out of control that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both. so part of the £ we are going to apply to filling the government s black hole reducing the borrowing. the rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today. mr howard is expected to say that around £ will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on monday. the cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter david james. home office spending could be cut by £. according to the final instalment of his year-long review. savings of £ at the foreign office and £ at the department for culture media and sport have also been identified. in all almost a quarter of a million jobs and public bodies would go under mr james proposals. mr howard said: all this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and a conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less. however chief treasury secretary paul boateng said: none of the tories figures add up so they can t make these savings and can t pay for any tax cuts which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is £ of cuts hitting frontline public services hard. liberal democrat leader charles kennedy added: people will not be taken in by michael howard s claims of £ worth of savings. this can t be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities. a poll for the news of the world newspaper suggests the conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century. labour will hold key marginal constituencies winning a majority of the populus survey suggests. and the liberal democrats will take three key seats from the conservatives leaving the tories with just mps two less than they returned atlabour s landslide and their worst showing since .

662,russia wto talks make progress talks on russia s proposed membership of the world trade organisation (wto) have been making good progress say those behind the negotiations. but the chairman of the working party ambassador stefan johannesson of iceland warned that there was still a lot of work has to be done . his comments came as president george w bush said the us backed russian entry. but he said for russia to make progress the government must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law . his comments come three days before he is due to meet president vladimir putin. russia has been waiting for a decade to join the wto and hopes to finally become a member by early . a decision could be reached in december when the wto s current members gather for a summit in hong kong. that would allow an earliest date for membership of january if the hong kong summit gave its approval. while pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with russia the us said the meeting was much more efficient than we ve seen for some time . and australia said it was one of the best (meetings) we can recall in terms of substance . mr johannesson also said progress on the bilateral market access side is accelerating . sticking points to membership have included limits on foreign ownership in the telecommunications and life insurance businesses as well as issues surrounding counterfeiting piracy and data protection. some wto members also dislike russia s energy price subsidies which competitors say give russian businesses an unfair advantage.
2043,the year search became personal the odds are that when you fire up your browser you go straight to your favourite search engine rather than type in a web address. some may see this as the height of laziness but in an era of information overload search has become a vital tool in navigating the net. it is symptomatic of how the way we use the internet is changing. and as google has shown there is money in offering a service that people cannot live without. there is no shortage of companies vying for the loyalty of web searchers offering a wealth of different services and tools to help you find what you want. over the past months giants of the technology world such as microsoft and yahoo have sought to grab a slice of the search action. user experience has contributed to people searching more said yonca brunini of yahoo. as people become more familiar with the internet they tend to spend more time online and ask more queries she said. the other second thing is broadband ms brunini told the bbc news website. this will do to internet what colour has done to tv. but search is hardly a new phenomenon. it has been around since the early days of the net. veteran surfers will remember old-timers like hotbot and altavista. search was always important said urs holzle google vice-president of operations. we trumpeted that in . it is even truer now as there are more users and more information. people didn t realise that search was the future. the financials have something to do with it. google has shown web commerce can work through its targeted small adverts which appear at the top and down the right-hand side of a page and are related to the original search. these small ads helped google reach revenues of $. for the three months to september. others have woken up to the fact that you can make money out of web queries. once you see there is a market microsoft is bound to step to it. if microsoft sees search as important then nobody queries it said mr holzle. microsoft is just one of the net giants muscling in on search. yahoo ask jeeves amazon and a handful of smaller outfits are all seeking to capture eyeballs. web users face a plethora of choices as each company tries to outflank google by rolling out new search products such as desktop search. it reflects how the battlefield has shifted from the net to your pc. search is not just about finding your way around the web. it is now about unlocking information hidden in the gigabytes of documents images and music on hard drives. for all these advances search is still a clumsy tool often failing to come up with exactly what you had in mind. in order to do a better job search engines are trying to get to know you better doing a better job of remembering cataloguing and managing all the information you come across. personalisation is going to be a big area for the future said yahoo s yonca brunini. whoever cracks that and gives you the information you want is going to be the winner. we have to understand you to give you better results that are tailored to you. this is perhaps the holy grail of search understanding what it is you are looking for and providing it quickly. the problem is that no one yet knows how to get there.

1776,labour accused of eu propaganda a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise on the eu is being used to lull the british public into a false sense of security say the tories. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution. his claims were denied by foreign secretary jack straw who accused the tories of running scared of debate. eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls he argued. mr straw used thursday s commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in . security stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july said mr straw. africa and climate change would also feature highly. he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to % of europe s economic output and were spent where it adds most value . mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uk s budget rebate secured in by margaret thatcher was fully justified . we like all other countries have a veto on any changes proposed in this area he said. mr ancram condemned the document which the foreign office says has cost about £ to design print and deliver. isn t the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new eu to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election he asked. the tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the eu constitution would make europe easier to understand. the government last week had to publish a commentary of pages to try and explain this easy and simple constitution to the british people he said. who are they trying to kid the proposed question for the constitution referendum is: should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. the government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring with the tories set to campaign for a no vote. mr ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. the foreign secretary hit back by saying tory attitudes to europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a level playing field on immigration and asylum controls. you are setting your face against all of these things he added. for the liberal democrats sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy. change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets he argued. sir menzies was among those worried about plans backed by the uk to lift the arms embargo imposed on china after the tiananmen square massacre. mr straw said no decisions had been taken - chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.
373,aviator creator in oscars snub the man who said he got oscar-nominated movie the aviator off the ground and signed up leonardo dicaprio has been shut out of the academy awards race. charles evans jr battled over his role with the people who eventually made the film and won a producer s credit. but he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. the oscars organisers have picked two of the aviator s four producers to be nominated for best film. up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind the aviator and million dollar baby failed to trim their credits - so the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences (ampas) has done it for them. the aviator s nominated producers are michael mann and graham king - with mr evans and sandy climan mr mann s former deputy left off. mr evans sued mr mann in claiming he came up with the idea spent years developing it and persuaded dicaprio to play hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. the two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact mr evans name has appeared as a producer when the film s credits roll. at the golden globes mr evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with dicaprio director martin scorsese mr mann and mr king. ampas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after shakespeare in love s victory in saw five producers collect awards. the eligible names for the aviator and million dollar baby were decided by ampas producers branch executive committee on wednesday. the decision also saw clint eastwood get his third personal nomination for million dollar baby. he is now named in the best film category as well as being nominated for best director and best lead actor. the academy awards ceremony will be held in hollywood on february. chinese actress ziyi zhang star of crouching tiger hidden dragon hero and house of flying daggers is the latest name to be added to the list of presenters on the night.
468,guantanamo four free in weeks all four britons held by the us in guantanamo bay will be returned to the uk within weeks foreign secretary jack straw told the commons on tuesday. moazzam begg from birmingham and martin mubanga richard belmar and feroz abbasi from london have been held by the us for almost three years. they were detained in the cuban camp as part of the us-led war on terror . mr straw said the us had agreed to release the four after intensive and complex discussions over security. he said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since . all four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government mr straw said. but he added: once they are back in the uk the police will consider whether to arrest them under the terrorism act for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity. the shadow foreign secretary michael ancram welcomed the return of the four detainees. but he said there were still serious questions both over the possible threat the four pose to the uk and the treatment they received while detained. liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell said the four had been rescued from a legal no-man s land . their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process. azmat begg father of moazzam thanked his lawyers and the british people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son s release. he added: if they have done something wrong of course they should be punished but if they haven t they shouldn t have been there. lawyer louise christian who represents mr abbasi and mr mubanga said the government should have acted sooner. she said: they should at the outset have said quite clearly to the american government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the british government wanted no part of it and wanted guantanamo bay shut down. they didn t do that. they colluded with it. moazzam begg s labour mp roger godsiff welcomed his release but said questions remained unanswered particularly about charges. asked about possible damages mr begg and the other detainees could bring against the us mr godsiff said: people get released from prison when it s found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. i don t see any difference in this case. human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in cuba. amnesty international has called camp delta a major human-rights scandal and an icon of lawlessness . both amnesty and the lobby group guantanamo human rights commission described the release as long overdue . civil rights group liberty said it was delighted but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the uk without charge or trial. director shami chakrabarti called on the government to practise what it preaches and either free or charge detainees at belmarsh and woodhill prisons. law lords ruled last month that the were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. the us has also announced that -year-old australian mamdouh habib previously accused of terrorist offences will be released without charge from camp delta. five british detainees released from guantanamo in march last year were questioned by uk police before being released without charge.
1188,belle named best scottish band belle & sebastian have been named the best scottish band of all time after a three month-long public poll. the group beat travis and idlewild into second and third place respectively. franz ferdinand who recently picked up five brit award nominations ended up in place while the eurythmics wound up at a lowly . other scottish acts such as the mull historical society who also featured in the top performed at a party in glasgow where the result was announced. scottish-based band snow patrol who finished in the vote and have been nominated for a pair of brit awards were among the performers who covered well-known scottish pop songs at the party on wednesday night. indie stalwarts belle & sebastian have enjoyed a chart career stretching back to . they were the surprise winners of the brit award for best breakthrough act two years later. scottish bands from earlier musical eras also made it into the final list including tartan boy band the bay city rollers and goth favourites the jesus and mary chain. scottish magazine the list recently compiled a list of the top scottish bands of all time but left the final decision to the public. the magazine s music editor mark robertson said: the idea behind the project was simple - to rediscover the very best of scottish music from the finest musical talent spanning from the age of rock through to pop right up to today s international stars. everyone has strong opinions about this and we wanted to open it up to the public to decide he added. bbc radio scotland presenter vic galloway who has been involved in the project said it had been great fun to look back at scotland s musical heritage and take note of up-and-coming scottish acts.

1667,broadband in the uk gathers pace one person in the uk is joining the internet s fast lane every seconds according to bt. the telecoms giant said the number of people on broadband via the telephone line had now surpassed four million. including those connected via cable almost six million people have a fast always-on connection. the boom has been fuelled by fierce competition and falling prices as well as the greater availability of broadband over the phone line. the take-up rate for broadband is accelerating at a terrific pace said ben verwaayen bt s chief executive. we will be in a very strong position to hit our five million target by summer much earlier than we had previously expected. the last million connections were made over the past four months with thousands of people being added to the total every day of the week. those signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name. part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk s most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond six kilometres. asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. the standard speed is though faster connections are available. according to bt more than % of uk homes and businesses can receive broadband over the phone line. it aims to extend this figure to .% by next summer. there are also an estimated . million cable broadband customers in the uk.
1192,eu rules won t stop uk spending the shape of the uk s economy in graphics but he denied that he was ruling out british membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic tests this year. mr brown said that it was vital the uk continued to invest in infrastructure science and education in the future. otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of china he told mps. the chancellor said that the eu s planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force britain to run a budget surplus of % over the economic cycle. under mr brown s rules the uk current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit. he told the house of commons treasury select committee that the eu rules make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure . but he argued that the eu was moving in the direction of the uk principles and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year to include investment and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year. under mr brown s sustainable investment rule government debt should be under % - in contrast to the % allowed under the growth and stability pact. mr brown vigorously denied conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules. in march the office of national statistics (ons) reclassified £. of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only £. conservative michael fallon asked mr brown whether the treasury had leaned on ons to make this change and said that the ons had received a written paper from the treasury on this matter. but the chancellor said mr fallon was impugning the integrity of the office of national statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently. mr brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap. he told the treasury select committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost treasury coffers. earlier ex-conservative chancellor ken clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone. speaking on radio s today programme mr clarke said political give and take would replace more rigid rules. but fellow tory david heathcoat-amory said the folly of the system was in trying to run europe s varied economies on one set of rules. the essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake he said. the warning is about the european constitution which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution. it gives more powers to brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy. but speaking to the treasury select committee gordon brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership. the conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact mr. brown said.

1775,china blocks google news site china has been accused of blocking access to google news by the media watchdog reporters without borders. the paris-based pressure group said the english-language news site had been unavailable for the past days. it said the aim was to force people to use a chinese edition of the site which according to the watchdog does not include critical reports. google told the bbc news website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes. china is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world. a net police force monitors websites and e-mails and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information. popular chinese portals such as sina.com and sohu.com maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments. and all net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive. china is censoring google news to force internet users to use the chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports said the group in a statement. by agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government google has let itself be used by beijing it said. for its part the search giant said it was looking into the issue. it appears that many users in china are having difficulty accessing google news sites in china and we are working to understand and resolve the issue said a google spokesperson. google news gathers information from some news sources. headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm with no human editorial intervention. it offers editions of the service including one tailored for china and one for hong kong. google launched a version in simplified chinese in september. the site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information. but google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within china as this would result in broken links.
2209,time to get tough on friendlies for an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players. the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the minutes at the end. i would say it s - whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so. it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil. often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. and it s very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole team s worth. the debate will rage on and i m not sure there is a satisfactory solution. one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith. the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts. it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is a canny manager. the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers. if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever. john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary. he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results. it s extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. england s game against holland is a good example. it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson. but you have got to remember sven-goran eriksson s side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played. the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress. for the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed.
1258,honda wins china copyright ruling japan s honda has won a copyright case in beijing further evidence that china is taking a tougher line on protecting intellectual property rights. a court ruled that chongqing lifan industry group must stop selling honda brand motorbikes and said it must pay . yuan ($ ) in compensation. internationally recognized regulation is now a key part of china s plans for developing its economy analysts said. beijing also has been threatened with sanctions if it fails to clamp down. chinese firms copy products ranging from computer software and spark plugs to baby milk and compact discs. despite the fact that product piracy is a major problem foreign companies have only occasionally won cases and the compensation awarded has usually been small. still recent rulings and announcements will have boosted optimism that attitudes are changing. earlier this week china said that in future it will punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail. and on tuesday paws incorporated - the owner of the rights to garfield the cat - won a court battle against a publishing house that violated its copyright. other firms that have taken legal action in china with varying degrees of success include yamaha general motors and toyota. the problem of piracy is not limited to china however and the potential for profit is huge. the european union estimates that the global trade in pirated wares is worth more than euros a year (£; $) or about % of total world trade. and it is growing. between and the number of counterfeit or pirated goods intercepted at the eu s external borders increased by more than % it said. last month the eu said it will start monitoring china ukraine and russia to ensure they are going after pirated goods. other countries on the eu s hit list include thailand brazil south korea and indonesia. any countries that are not making enough of an effort could be dragged to the world trade organisation (wto) a step that could trigger economic sanctions the eu warned.

1359,howard taunts blair over splits tony blair s feud with gordon brown is damaging the way the uk is governed tory leader michael howard has claimed in a heated prime minister s questions. mr howard asked: how can they fight crime when they are fighting each other that question was later unveiled as the headline for new tory campaign posters. but mr blair dismissed the talk of splits and said people s priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by labour. he can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages low inflation low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to he said. the chancellor is currently on a high-profile tour of africa to highlight new anti-poverty plans. but before doing so he insisted he still trusted mr blair despite claims to the contrary in a new book. brown s britain by robert peston says there is mutual animosity between the two men. it claims mr blair said in november he would stand down as prime minister before the next election. but he went back on his pledge after support from cabinet allies and suspicion that mr brown was manoeuvring against him it says. mr peston s book claimed that mr brown told mr blair: there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe. mr blair directly denied that quote on wednesday. he again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit. the tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor. he declared: he is the deals on meals prime minister. no wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater. he continued: how can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government how can they clean up our hospitals when they don t clean up their act mr blair said he would not respond to tittle tattle in books and promised to hail labour s record on the economy waiting lists and law and order from now until polling day . later at their poster launch tory co-chairman liam fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how juvenile the prime minister and chancellor were. labour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on tuesday where mr brown was joined by alan milburn who mr blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor. but liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc news: the government is clearly split at the top. this kind of cosmetic exercise does not persuade anybody. later this week mr blair is expected to outline the direction of his party s next election manifesto. the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday s meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made mr peston s book.

1500,smartphones suffer skulls attack owners of some nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper. those downloading the software could find all the icons on their phone swapped for images of skulls. when installed the malicious program also locks many of the s functions making it hard to use and harder to repair. the program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones. the file nicknamed skulls is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons such as wallpaper games and ringtones for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it. the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the phone. the skulls program is labelled as a file called: .extended.theme.manager.zip. once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications such as contacts calendar notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls. a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it one of which includes ignoring a security warning. symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself. despite this finnish anti-virus lab f-secure said it had sporadic reports of owners being caught out by it. the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again. the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee-. symbian phones produced by sony ericsson motorola benq arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program.
2140,celts savour grand slam prospect the six nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face a potential grand slam play-off in three weeks time. but before that game in cardiff wales must get past scotland at murrayfield while ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial french. no-one knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on march - sublime as in the first half against wales or ridiculous like in the same period against england at twickenham. but how the mighty have fallen. england sat on rugby s summit months ago as world champions and grand slam winners. but they have lost nine of their matches since that heady night in sydney. and they face the ignominy of what could amount to a wooden spoon play-off against italy in a fortnight. england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in . coach andy robinson who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september has lost a phalanx of world cup stars. and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team. the same year that england ruled the roost a woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations. and they won only two games against scotland and italy in . wales most recent championship title was in and their last grand slam success came in in the era of gareth edwards phil bennett jpr williams et al. but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age. after several false dawns coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations. the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas now out with a broken thumb accurate kicking from either fly-half stephen jones or centre gavin henson a rampant martyn williams leading the way up front and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams. ireland coach eddie o sullivan and captain brian o driscoll have got their side buzzing too and they are close to shedding the nearly-men tag that has dogged them for the past few years. the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runners-up for the past two years to france and england. but they have not won the title since and last clinched a grand slam in . as for scotland they have struggled this decade and the wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in . italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win and can still only account for the scalps of scotland (twice) and wales since joining the elite in . coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri but is lacking in raw materials. and so to france. brilliant one minute inept the next. but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door. ireland though have won three times in their last five meetings. welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam. but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on march.

1225,millions to lose textile jobs millions of the world s poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year a charity has warned. the world trade organisation (wto) is to end its multi-fibre agreement (mfa) on midnight of december. christian aid condemned the move saying it would see almost a million jobs in bangladesh alone being axed. however supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for western consumers. it will also see more jobs created in india and china advocates argue. the wto said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. there will be a period of adjustment required said wto spokesman keith rockwell. some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships. christian aid has called on british firms not to simply cut and run but look after their workers in a new report called rags to riches to rags. it added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. the wto itself has warned that as many as million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. some of the world s fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in bangladesh textiles account for almost % of the country s exports and the industry employs around . million people. the mfa pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. the losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as bangladesh cambodia sri lanka and nepal andrew pendleton christian aid s head of trade policy said. they will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. we are deeply concerned that the new year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers. the wto said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market. it added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered adding such seismic changes to policy should put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost . while the current mfa was not perfect its did allow third world countries like bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development christian aid said. international trade must not be governed by a race to the bottom that pitches one set of poor people against another mr pendleton added.

251,federer joins all-time greats the last year has seen one player dominate men s tennis and one country dominate the women s game. roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in to win three grand slams in one season. and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win a grand slam at the french open two more followed at wimbledon and the us open. meanwhile briton tim henman enjoyed his best year while greg rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles and set about conquering new ground. the swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the australian open. he ripped through the draw before beating marat safin in the final. andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon and federer s performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking. federer again got the better of hewitt in the season-ending masters cup. his victory in houston proved to be his successive win in a final an open era record. the only major let-down was a third-round loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open and roland garros will be his main target in . there was also a surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold. another major trophy that looks beyond federer is the davis cup which was won by spain in a - home success over the usa in seville. roddick struggled on the clay losing to rafael nadal on the opening day before going down to carlos moya in the all-important fourth rubber. henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the french open - a stunning effort - and also at the us open. a quarter-final defeat to mario ancic at wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the briton s defeat but he remains optimistic of going further next year. british number two rusedski endured a rollercoaster year returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in march. with his ranking down at many feared the -year-old s career was over but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top . the russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in with myskina maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams before taking the season-ending fed cup. but while the young russians were on the way up it was a different story for the belgians and the williams sisters. only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay a stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo whose grand slam drought goes on. the year started in regulation fashion as justine henin-hardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open. a virus ruined the rest of henin-hardenne s year although she was fit enough to win olympic gold but clijsters had an even more miserable . she suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt and will be happy to see the year end. in their absence myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic but woeful all-russian final at the french open. wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as sharapova captivated showing nerves of steel as she battled past davenport and serena williams to take the title. davenport was a strong favourite for the us open but hampered by injury lost to the powerful and unflappable kuznetsova in the semis. kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing with the latter s wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. with the russians still improving the likes of henin-hardenne clijsters davenport mauresmo venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in . and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the men s side.
717,child access laws shake-up parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied lord falconer said. the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday. he denied fathers activists had forced the changes telling the bbc there is a recognition that something is wrong . between and couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year although in nine out of separations there is no court intervention. lord falconer told bbc radio s today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. but he opposed compulsory mediation saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. other plans include: - parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements based on real-life examples that have worked in the past - extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases - better access to legal emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet - legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes. judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a nuclear option which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child s interests a spokesman said. the aim of the new legislation was to provide a medium range of penalties such as fines community service orders compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews. failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents lord falconer said: tagging may be going too far but let s have a debate about that. full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published in the next two weeks a spokesman said. the government s proposals have met with disapproval from fathers rights groups. john ison from the controversial group fathers justice said: it is very disappointing. what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation. jim parton from families need fathers said the new proposals lacked compulsion . we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand you know what the minimum access is. otherwise you see people make agreements which then fall apart. mr parton said he had been told by children s minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election which is likely to take place in may. the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. theresa may shadow secretary for the family told bbc radio s today programme that the government s plans were inadequate and were papering over the cracks of the current system . she said a conservative government would bring a radical reform of the family courts as well as enforcing a legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation . we want to make courts the last resort rather than the first resort she added. the government says children cannot simply be divided up like property when a marriage collapses. the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules rather than having rigid targets .
1965,bomb threat at bernabeu stadium spectators were evacuated from real madrid s bernabeu stadium on sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and real sociedad. more than people abandoned the ground with the score at - and only three minutes left to play. the basque newspaper gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at local time. but after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs the police said that no explosive device had been found. the police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything said real madrid president florentino perez. the best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us. madrid midfielder guti told private spanish radio station cadena ser: i have never seen this before and sport should be above it all. real took the lead just before the break when brazilian striker ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when turkish striker nihat kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. it is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand. if the result remains at - real will drop to third place in the standings points behind leaders barcelona who snatched a late - win at albacete on saturday. initial reports suggested the basque separatist group eta may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. the bernabeu was targeted by eta on may when madrid were about to play fc barcelona in a champions league semi-final. a car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and people were slightly injured.
1174,what really divides the parties so what is the gap between labour and the tories nowadays one starbucks one rymans and one small greek cafe as it happens. both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters with labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the tories new headquarters in victoria street just down the road from the commons. that should make things a little easier if and when the crack-of-dawn election press conferences kick off. unlike there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside or to buy scooters to get themselves between the tightly-timetabled events. and to all intents and purposes we already appear to be in that general election campaign. certainly the press conference hosted by election co-ordinator alan milburn in the rather compact new conference room - still smelling of new carpet and with the garish new labour coffee mugs as yet unstained - had all the hallmarks of an election event. welcome to the unremittingly new labour media centre he said. and i ll bet he hadn t checked that one with gordon brown. along with work and pensions secretary alan johnson and minister for work jane kennedy he then went on to tear into the tory plans to scrap the new deal welfare-to-work scheme which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost in unemployment. and they ridiculed the claims made on monday by michael howard that he could save £ billion of labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering £ billion of tax cuts. labour has come up with a figure of £ billions worth of efficiency savings so understandably perhaps believe mr howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra £ billion. these figures based on the two parties own detailed studies will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign. wednesday was just the start.
227,all black magic: new zealand rugby playing colours: all black the haka and more! the all blacks charles john munro discovered rugby at london s christ college and on his return to nelson he staged new zealand s first game. nelson town met nelson college on may the town triumphing by two goals to nil instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country s sporting passions. the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport s warrior ethos. in a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english ex-pat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team. twenty-two maori and four pakiha formed the new zealand native team who played a total of matches in new zealand australia and the uk. the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the maori war dance the haka! the other great symbol of new zealand rugby the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in . new zealand played their first international against australia in the kiwis triumphing - in sydney and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time. the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain david revell bedell-sivright created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude. the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a - triumph in wellington sparking great celebrations across the country but bedell-sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk. their opportunity to prove him wrong came in with the first official new zealand tour to europe. the tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking inventive approach but press criticism began to grow over their -- scrum formation that left a roving forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. the tactic was effective two late tries seeing the kiwis to a - win over scotland before ireland were despatched - in dublin. a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a - hammering of england. new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first golden age and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a - win in a hard-fought encounter at cardiff arms park but post-match talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas. dallas said that deans was tackled short but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed: i did score that try in cardiff. four of the all blacks went over to the newly formed all golds rugby league side soon after the tour but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo-welsh touring team in . the first south africa tour of new zealand in saw honours shared in a three-test series starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the all blacks inclusion of maori players. the awesome - all black tourists became known as the invincibles after winning all of their games in france britain and ireland including a crushing - victory over wales at st helen s. despite their success the all blacks -- scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in . employing the modern -- scrum line-up against the new zealand rover system for the first time south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two-all. the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the lions tour (a series won - by new zealand) the lions manager describing the tactic as cheating prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum. the all blacks european tour started inauspiciously with an - loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage schoolboy half-backs hayden tanner and willie davies. a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales - although the winning try from geoffrey rees-jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build-up. new zealand s next visit to wales in proved difficult as they lost - to cardiff and drew - at swansea. the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park but the teams were locked at - when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous match-winning try. the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations before a - success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller. new zealand built from that tour and by the time they returned in - they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world. that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely - win over the tourists at rodney parade. wilson whinneray s side rallied to beat wales - their first win at the arms park in four attempts and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour but when they returned home the first question put to them was: what happened in newport the only blemish on the record of the awesome tourists was a draw with east wales as they beat the full wales team - in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team. a ferocious game at the arms park in was edged - by the all blacks a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james-inspired lions of . james guided llanelli to a famous - win over the tourists at stradey park though and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks - in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. new zealand defeated a wales xv - at the arms park in a non-cap game in but it was the game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries. wales were leading - with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a line-out. television pictures clearly showed that he dived but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty duly converted by brian mckechnie for a - win. since that infamous game the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. a crushing - win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union s centenary game was a sign of things to come. the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside - in brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural world cup. the kiwis went on to claim the cup and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill-fated tour of new zealand. a young talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them - and -. after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of wales best players - chose to head north to rugby league. a - win in cardiff followed for new zealand in and at the world cup wales big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg. a crushing - kiwi triumph in wembley followed in and as wales misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen. there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff s new millennium stadium in they left with a - victory. a bruising - defeat followed for wales in hamilton in as hansen built towards the world cup but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope. wales were given no chance going into the game but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead - early in the second half. new zealand rallied to a - win but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over years. they have a chance but clearly history is not on their side.
1553,blair pledges unity to labour mps tony blair has sought to reassure labour backbenchers that nothing will stand in the way of the party s bid for a third term in power. mr blair was speaking to mps amid fresh rumours of a rift with gordon brown. a new book says the prime minister went back on a pledge to mr brown to stand down before the next general election. the chancellor has said he is focused on winning the poll and is due to join election supremo alan milburn for a labour poster launch this week. mr blair told the parliamentary labour party (plp) on monday: i know from everyone here in cabinet and government nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need. the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other and seemingly in good spirits at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour. a new book brown s britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston says mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june . it has caused a new wave of concern among labour mps gearing up to defend their seats in an election widely expected to be held in may and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the plp meeting. health secretary john reid earlier warned that labour members would not easily forgive anybody fuelling damaging speculation. he told bbc news: those who co-operate or inspire these books in my view have to know that whatever the short-term political or personal advantage that they think they might secure they always do it by damaging the record the unity and the re-election chances of the labour party and the government. mr blair on sunday dismissed claims of broken promises saying: i ve dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don t do deals over jobs like this - you don t. in a separate bbc interview mr brown said he and the prime minister would not be distracted by gossip . it s very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government he said. on monday mr blair s spokesman said: the prime minister is determined that he will get on with the business of government because he believes that what people want. mr brown says he discussed the election campaign with mr blair on saturday and promised to play his part. mr peston said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt . mr blair had decided in november he would quit because he felt he had lost voters trust because of the iraq war. he had then changed his mind in june following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him. mr brown allegedly said he could no longer believe anything mr blair told him. conservative co-chairman liam fox likened the two men to self-obsessed schoolboys . liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said their personal ambition was getting in the way of good government . ex-labour leader neil kinnock said mr blair and mr brown could only deal with the media frenzy by continuing to say they would not allow a row to damage labour or british interests. he told bbc radio five live that mr brown would never encourage any kind of insurrection or coup.

977,jones happy with henson heroics wales fly-half stephen jones admitted he was happy to hand gavin henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against england. jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when wales - down were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in cardiff. i knew the percentages of gavin reaching it were far higher than me jones said. when he said he wanted it there were no problems. jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour before charlie hodgson put england in front with minutes left. i looked at where it was and i knew i was going to struggle to make it jones added. i said to gareth (thomas the wales captain) this is touch and go. it was out of my range and obviously gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. he was confident and fancied it. there were no questions that he d miss it the way he was playing. he had a superb game. jones was happy to hail henson s heroic contribution to wales first win over england in cardiff since . physically he s a specimen: he s a balanced player he glides when he runs and obviously he s got a great kicking game as well jones said. his defence was superb he made some great hits and he had a great game. i m glad he s welsh. victory over england for the first time since will no doubt fuel expectations of what wales might achieve in this year s six nations. but they now face three away fixtures in italy france and scotland before completing their campaign against ireland in cardiff. people all over the world want to see wales back at the top table of world rugby said a proud coach mike ruddock. but we are not there yet. the next step is finding the consistency to get further wins. we have to travel this week and we can t afford to get too giddy about this result. we have got to be professional and keep focused on facing italy. none more so than henson who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of jonny wilkinson and brian o driscoll. the confident -year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however. i m the sort of player who likes pressure on me he said. it makes me more concentrated and i think i perform better under more pressure. i set a high standard against england and i ve got to back it up next week. two years ago when we played italy i wasn t involved and we lost so we ve got to put that right next week.
435,mac mini heralds mini revolution the mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month. but does the latest macintosh justify the hype let us get a few things dealt with at the outset - yes the mac mini is really really small and yes it is another piece of inspired apple design. there is more to be said on the computer s size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer. inside that small box there is a processor a cd/dvd player a hard drive some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system. a dvd burner wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost. and if you do not have a monitor keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also. it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under £ you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications - apple software. the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x the operating system as well as ilife a suite of software which includes itunes web browser safari iphoto garage band and idvd. i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with a better suite of programs than mac os x. of course users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs. for people who want to do interesting things with their music photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer. it s a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses said mark sparrow technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine. he added: in essence it s a laptop in a biscuit tin minus the screen and the keyboard. the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look a bit sick. the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically-savvy to experiment with their macs. one user has already created a dock to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car. the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for in-car entertainment - playing movies and music - as well as navigation. another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse. when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre - ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes music films and photos - partly due to its small living room friendly design. but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case - at least not in the here and now the hard drive - at for the larger model - is too small to be realistically used as media centre. while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content. a media centre computer has to store music files and photos and as such just seems too small. most pcs running windows media center have at least hard disks. coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is not what it is not. but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses. so - is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing graham barlow editor of mac format understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint. it s just a mac but we should be very excited - it s revolutionary in its size (smaller than pcs) looks (looks better than pcs) and the fact that it s the first mac designed to really go for the low-cost pc market. the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland bulky boxes. there are a number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on mini-itx motherboards. but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the home-build enthusiast or expensive pre-built options based around microsoft s media center software. but for the value the mac mini offers bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before apple is to be congratulated. let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution - it is a mini revolution.
677,minimum wage increased to £. the minimum wage will rise in october benefiting more than people the government has announced. adults must be paid at least £. an hour up from £. while to year olds will be paid £.. the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in . businesses wanted it frozen warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a £ rate. a further increase in the adult rate to £. an hour is provisionally scheduled for october . according to the commission many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage challenging . we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact said chairman adair turner. the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning catering shops and hairdressing. unveiling the latest increase mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a symbol of decency and fairness . for too long poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard-working families he said. too often people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay. chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast. the government has not accepted the commission s recommendation that -year-olds should be paid at the adult rate but says it will look again at the rate later on. mr brown said: we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time. the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage. the national minimum wage is currently set at £. per hour for those aged and above and at £. for those aged to . a £ per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for to -year-olds but apprentices are exempt. the trade unions congress welcomed the increase but has called for a £ minimum wage by next year. but the confederation of british industry (cbi) called for a pause year to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october. and david frost director of the british chambers of commerce said: the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation. what employers are saying to us now is that it s at a level where it s starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country. the liberal democrats economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage. it s not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too he said. conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not seek to disturb the increase. speaking on bbc radio s woman s hour mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest-paid workers. there are people on very low salaries very low incomes indeed who really shouldn t be paying income tax he said. it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below £ a year with say no tax on below £ . the losses in tax can be recouped by having a tax band for people making over £ . our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage yet our economy per person is only / of the us! perhaps we have to really starting questioning why some products cost -% more here than they do in the us. this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low-paid people do make go much further. it s still not good enough! i got a part time job at when i was doing my a-levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni. this was only years ago and i was getting paid £. an hour and working as hard as any of the older staff maybe it s about time - year olds got a fair wage! we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad. still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it. an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together. any increase is certainly welcome news. however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them: would you be happy to work for less than £. an hour . thought not ... so then don t expect others to either. i can t believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage! also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you it s about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn t go a miss either. br /&gt; this is good news. the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker s relationship with their employer. wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employee s efforts. for too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with. in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low. with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed. it is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders. they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat-cat salaries bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr! i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can t afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life. its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out. here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses! we all remember michael howard s protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he s gone quiet on that one! jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in. i think if any job is worth doing then it s worth being paid a fair wage for and £. is hardly a fortune. if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it s not being run properly and if it folds a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people so everybody wins except incompetent business owners! great keep at it tony i remember the despair of the and the low wages employers got away with. at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working. we can t afford not to pay a decent wage. it s not a jobs at any price economy goodbye sweatshops hello decency. the increase in minimum wage is a good thing. living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely (like the rest of the country) over the past years has made living for you average - years old very difficult. in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by an hour. hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard but might never earn a figure salary the chance to branch out on our own. i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of £. as the basic rate. someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently. how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow this is definitely the right step in the right direction. it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well. this is a million votes more. good strategy isn t it although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase its timing stinks. i am quite prepared for a raft of bribes to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards they are playing us for the fools they think we are. this is extremely bad news for any business - whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies. by increasing overheads for business there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt or that pair of trainers for next to nothing. the extra cost this increase will bring will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy which in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting-up business in the uk or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere. the jubilation felt by low-paid workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs. this will only lead to a reduction in jobs. why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india. blair say s the economy is strong and stable economy however consumer debt and the country s debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses that will have no choice but to cut the workforce. the timing cannot be coincidental. this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such. andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is blatant electioneering . i don t mind if it is. in our degraded democracy elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority. my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed. if my maths is right a hour week at £. gives you an annual income just over £ and raising it to £ leaves it under £ . the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more. businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm. i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers. also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost. we are already seeing a sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less. it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as sweat shop but now we are told it is global competition. with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve. there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing. the whole picture needs to be looked at. this is great news but that might be because i work for minimum wage. seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job. when you can earn more from claiming than you can from work there is no incentive. perhaps a step in the right direction. if the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close - this will put more people out of work. how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures! the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies. we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us. while i m delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses. as an employee for a small nursery i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october s increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum. this latest increase of an hour will cause even more financial hardship. if the rate rises to £ then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees. the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business. although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential. the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff overtime being the first to go. i currently employ staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage. increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery. % of my costs are labour. the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the lower status jobs. i know about this great idea - don t bother getting qualifications laze about at school no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don t get fined because remember when you do eventually start working doesn t matter how lazy you are you ll be guaranteed a decent wage. the ones who suffer are the employers. i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won t take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door i don t believe in the minimum wage at all! i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them. now before everyone thinks that i am some rich-kid i can assure you i am not. i came from a very much working class background and started work years ago on a youth opportunity program earning £ per week. i worked hard went to college part time got my a-levels and degree & bettered myself. i now earn a figure salary. i did that through hard work and getting off my backside. a minimum wage just makes people complacent. to ashley of swindon: when you earned £ per week it was worth something. these days that £ would need to be near to £ to have the equivalent buying power. i might add that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done years ago at equivalent wages. in my day type arguments are a view that belong in the your day - years ago! as a graduate working for minimum wage i welcome any increase of pay i can get. i disagree with ashley swindon saying i have to work harder to get more pay. i have my gcse s a-levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can t afford the wages i should be getting i should be on at least what i m getting but they can t afford it. we all work hard but the money is just not there. but on the plus side i love my job and wouldn t change it just to get more pay. as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional £ per year. these next rises will cost me more. i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers. so no one really wins in the end. in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary mr blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well. if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the £. mark there will be more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine. think of us employers as well mr blair we are not all big corporations earning millions. all workers should be entitled to a fair day s pay for a fair day s work. how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement it is good news for many asians living in uk. students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country. i thank mr. blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.
1896,turkey turns on the economic charm three years after a gruelling economic crisis turkey has dressed its economy to impress. as part of a charm offensive - ahead of december when the european union will decide whether to start entry talks - turkey s economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements. the economy is growing fast they insist. education levels among its young and large population are rising. unemployment levels in percentage terms are heading fast towards single digits. inflation is under control. a new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards. the tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $ (£.) in three years. moreover government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled. income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract $ of foreign investment over the next three years. a loan restructuring deal with the international monetary fund (imf) is pretty much in the can. and following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent. the point of all this has been to convince europe s decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the eu allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits. the cake will be bigger for everybody said deputy prime minister abdullatif sener earlier this month. turkey will not be a burden for the eu budget. if admitted into the eu turkey would contribute almost euros ($; £) to its budget by according to a recent impact study by the country s state planning organisation. as turkey s gross domestic output (gdp) is set to grow by % per year on average its contribution would rise from less than euros in to almost euros by . turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in old europe once its population comes of age. by one in four turks - or about million people - will be aged or less. a literate and qualified turkish population insisted mr sener will make a positive impact on the eu. this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers wallets. however turkey s assertions are confirmed by brussels own impact studies which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy. but only over time. costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey s membership with subsidies alone estimated to exceed . euros and according to some predictions balloon to . euros. this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid though such payments should decline as the country s farm sector which currently employs one in three turks would employ just one in five by . such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey s government would never be delivered say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned. some fear that rather than providing an educated sophisticated labour force for europe at large the people who will leave turkey to seek work abroad will be poor uneducated - and plentiful. more recently less palatable concerns - at least in liberal european circles - have been voiced with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a river of islam an oriental culture and a threat to europe s cultural richness . of course many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country s muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government s human rights record. yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand. critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey s economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a % rise in the country s current account deficit to $. during the first months of this year. the country s massive debt - which includes $ owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu. in the new member states of the european union gross public debt is typically about % of gross domestic product says reza moghadam assistant director of the imf s european department. at about % of gdp turkey s gross debt is double that figure. turkey s debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in caused the country s devastating recession. there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past it remains quite vulnerable says michael deppler director of the imf s european department. its debt is far too high for an emerging economy. a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria. but economics is not a science. and although the state of turkey s economy is important as is its pace of reform the final decision on december will be taken by politicians who will of course be guided by their political instincts.
359,baa support ahead of court battle uk airport operator baa has reiterated its support for the government s aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country. the comments come a day ahead of a high court challenge by residents groups and local councils to the government s white paper. the judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at heathrow stansted and luton airports. baa which operates all three said it was consulting with local communities. we are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations a baa spokesman said. groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. at heathrow gatwick edinburgh and glasgow airports baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september which will close next week. the company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked unblighted price. among other measures baa has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near stansted and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. at heathrow baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. at gatwick the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. stop stansted expansion said the white paper published in december was fundamentally flawed and did not follow the proper consultation process. we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government white paper said stop stansted expansion chairman peter sanders said. hacan chairman john stewart said: almost exactly a year ago the government published its -year aviation white paper with much fanfare. it hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. yet a year later the protesters are still here and stronger than ever. a judgement from mr justice sullivan is expected early in february.

(£) bill in for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than of its people its central bank says. this estimate is preliminary bank governor sunil mendis told reporters and could rise in . the island state is asking for about $ from the international monetary fund to help pay for relief he said. the bank has rupees ($; £) set aside to lend at a lower interest rate to those who lost property. according to mr mendis half the imf support could come from a freeze on debt repayments which would free up resources immediately. the rest could come from a five-year emergency loan. sri lanka is hoping for a wider freeze from other creditors. the paris club of creditors meets on january to discuss a debt moratorium for the nations hit by the tsunami which ravaged south and east asia on december. some people across the region are feared to be dead and millions have been left homeless and destitute. a full reckoning of the economic cost to sri lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come. but already it looks likely that growth in the first half of will slow mr mendis told reporters although he would not say by how much. one side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country. the currency has strengthened % since late december coming close to rupees to the us dollar for the first time in more than six months.
486,kennedy looks to election gains they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics - the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition. but the liberal democrats are entering the expected election campaign determined to prove it is they not the tories who are now the real threat to labour. as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a fading force. and he insisted there was no limit to his party s ambitions in the coming poll. and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things. sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test. and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party s westminster hq. he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election. the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow - as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson - that only his party offered a genuine alternative. on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives. he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £ a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax. he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election. there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion. that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats. the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats. labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats. but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that. he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold. they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power. the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq. but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.

245,o connell rejects lions rumours ireland and munster lock paul o connell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the lions tour to new zealand this summer. o connell is rumoured to be among the front-runners for the job but says he is totally focused on sunday s six nations crunch clash with england. i honestly don t think about these reports he told bbc sport. the lions thing is all speculation and newspaper talk nothing more. i just ignore it and get on with my job. he added: the only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think. i can just imagine them saying i m going to show this guy what s what about second row play . that s the one thing that makes me cringe. o connell who made a try-scoring international debut against wales two years ago is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugby s shop window - but refuses to be drawn on the lions. i have spoken to sir clive woodward a few times but not for very long certainly nothing about summer holidays he joked. he also said he remains wary of wounded england s abilities coming into sunday s game after two straight defeats dismissing predictions of a certain irish victory. it s very dangerous to think that. this england team has so much experience and skill. you do not become a bad team overnight. they have two world class game-breakers in josh lewsey and jason robinson while charlie hodgson is just ready to click into place. he insisted ireland will not make the mistake of being over-confident. that s not going to happen in our squad. no ireland team lining up to play england will ever fall into that trap he said. every time we play england we know what a big task it is. look at what they did to us two years ago. i remember that game all too well and it was not a good feeling. i came on as a replacement and we were losing - and ended up getting hammered - so i know what can happen when england come to dublin. they could so easily have been coming to dublin with two wins and staring a grand slam in the face as well.
1971,thanou desperate to make return greek sprinter katerina thanou says she is eager to compete again after being cleared of missing a drugs test by an independent greek tribunal. thanou was provisionally suspended for missing a test before the olympics but the decision was overturned. the iaaf will decide if we can compete again in greece and abroad thanou told to vima newspaper in her first interview since the athens olympics. if given the green light i will run again - that s the only thing i want. thanou and her compatriot kostas kenteris were provisionally suspended by the iaaf in december for missing three drugs tests. the third was alleged to have been on the eve of the opening ceremony of the athens olympics. but an independent tribunal of the greek athletics federation overturned the provisional ban on march. the iaaf - which said it was very surprised by the decision of the greek tribunal - is deciding whether to appeal against the decision at the court of arbitration for sport. however dick pound the chairman of the world anti-doping authority has said he will appeal against the decision if the iaaf does not. and thanou and kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident. thanou said: i can see how people can think the accident seemed like a childish excuse. i cannot deny that we made a lot of mistakes during that time. i always said we needed a pr person. an athlete would have to be very stupid to take illegal substances when he or she knows that they will undergo tests at any given moment. i am a champion. i cannot risk everything i ve achieved in such a silly way.

748,tv debate urged for party chiefs broadcasters should fix a date for a pre-election televised debate between the three main political leaders according to the hansard society. it would then be up to tony blair michael howard and charles kennedy to decide whether to take part the non-partisan charity said. chairman lord holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter of public interest . the broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead he said. lord holme s proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch us president george w bush slug it out verbally with his democratic challenger john kerry. he said it was a democratically dubious proposition that it was up to the incumbent prime minister to decide whether a similar event takes place here. if mr blair did not want to take part the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why lord holme said. what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate no-one has heard directly from the prime minister he said. it has been left to nudges and winks hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that mr blair doesn t want one but we haven t heard from the prime minister himself. lord holme who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections said broadcasters were more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements . opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes he said. lord holme argued that as part of their public service obligations broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead as soon as the election is called. an independent third-party body such as the hansard society or electoral commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public he said. it would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse said lord holme. if the prime minister s reported position is true and he does want to take part he would then be obliged to say why publicly. the broadcasters would then have the option of cancelling the event for obvious and well-understood reasons or going ahead with an empty chair. either way would be preferable to the present hidden veto. the hansard society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in and . tony blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign. last month he said: we answer this every election campaign and for the reasons i have given before the answer is no he said at his monthly news conference.
1208,blair looks to election campaign tony blair s big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign. that poll may still be about weeks away but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing. the prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto. there was a detailed account of the government s past record with a major emphasis on the economy and public services. there was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with chancellor gordon brown. and there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly new labour - although that may continue to irritate his chancellor. there was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges although the prime minister talked about a new labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society . his was more a speech designed to remind people and some in his own party precisely what new labour stood for and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach. and for some that means showing that new labour actually does stand for something - that it is as he said more than an electoral device . to that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle england voters who switched to the party in and stuck with it possibly through some gritted teeth in and to more traditional lower income old labour supporters. in a key section he declared: in our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity. for the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability. every family - not just the fortunate few - knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood. every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship. every adult - including those who missed out at school - able to get the skills then need to advance. home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it. the highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions . under what is to be the general election slogan britain is working the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly new labour. that might get under the skin of mr brown but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post-war chancellor britain has had. probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men in so far as there is one is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services. an unremittingly new labour manifesto as the prime minister is happy to make plain will stress the importance of that - the belief patients and parents for example want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them. the chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle. with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and in particular the use of that little three letter word. but for now all eyes have been focused on the next general election. and for many in westminster mr blair s performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on may.
1565,ferdinand casts doubt over glazer rio ferdinand has said he is unsure of malcolm glazer s motives after the american billionaire launched a new offer to buy manchester united. the club have confirmed that the glazer family partnership have submitted proposals of a third bid. a lot of people want the club s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart said ferdinand. no one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table. the central defender added on bbc radio five live: we will have to wait and see what glazer comes with. i would like to see the situation resolved either way. i think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals. the other stuff off the pitch takes the shine off what is going on the pitch. glazer currently owns a .% stake in the club and united s statement to the stock exchange said: the board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject. the board can confirm that it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various pre-conditions which may form the basis of an offer for manchester united from glazer. a further announcement will be made in due course. glazer s previous bids for the club which united supporters opposed were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur. but it is believed that glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move. he will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus who own .% of the club to succeed. but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake while fans remain opposed to his involvement.
897,lib dems target the student vote students can decide the fate of mps in some seats at the next election liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has claimed. the party says the votes of students can win it new seats at the poll. the figures assume all students will vote in their university town. in fact some may vote where the parents live. the lib dems say scrapping university fees wins them student support. but the tories would also end fees and labour says both would cap people s ambitions. the lib dems have named the seats where there are enough students to take the lib dems from second place to beat labour and the where they could go from second to beat the tories. launching his campaign to win students votes at the london school of economics mr kennedy urged students to make their mark . he underlined lib dem plans to scrap university fees and reintroduce maintenance grants of up to £ . he said: top-up fees put students off university especially those from a poorer background. and is it really right that so many young people are starting out in life with mortgage-style debts hanging round their necks mr kennedy also said students want action on the environment and see the iraq war which his party opposed as a defining issue. labour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to £ a year with the poorest students eligible for non-repayable support of up to £ . ahead of mr kennedy s launch a labour spokesperson said: like the tories the liberal democrats would restrict access to higher education and put a cap on aspiration closing the door to students with good grades and restricting their life ambitions. they are committed to abandoning labour s targets of getting % of to -year-olds going into higher education and under lib dem plans students would even have to study near home. the conservatives say they would abolish university tuition fees and instead offer large student loans at commercial rates of interest. they say the lib dem policy would leave universities wholly dependent for their income on the goodwill of the chancellor. shadow education secretary tim collins is on thursday setting out a new scheme of vocational grants for to -year-olds to tackle what he says are crippling skills shortages . the lib dem analysis of the difference students could make to its election chances is based on all students being registered to vote near their university not in their home towns. although the expected may election would be during term time students can vote by post. the electoral commission and national union of students are worried students in halls of residence can find it hard to register to vote. some hall wardens are reluctant to register students because of data protection fears - but students can get themselves registered. if the election is on may voters need to register by march. - the seats where the lib dems say student votes can swing the election for them are: bristol west cardiff central leeds north west cambridge manchester gorton sheffield central oxford east newcastle-upon-tyne central liverpool riverside holborn and st pancras oldham east and saddleworth manchester withington islington south and finsbury birmingham yardley surrey south west taunton orpington haltemprice and howden eastbourne isle of wight dorset west bournemouth east wells canterbury cities of london and westminster bournemouth west westmorland and lonsdale.
504,kerr frustrated at victory margin republic of ireland manager brian kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over croatia. robbie keane took his republic record to with a first-half goal which proved enough for victory. we had more good chances. it is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team said kerr. but given the conditions and the standard of the croatian team we should be very happy with the win. the republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in matches and are unbeaten in home games since kerr succeeded mick mccarthy. kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory. it was a brilliant goal fantastic skill by damien duff. robbie might have scuffed it a little but it was a good goal. matchwinner keane was another full of praise for duff s role in the goal. it was great play from damien said the tottenham striker. i always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of duffer is going to get it in the box. playing three up was something different. brian kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young stephen elliott getting a run-out. the conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future. it is nice to see young players coming through. man-of-the-match duff explained what went wrong when he fluffed a chance to make it - midway through the second half. he opted to bring steve finnan s cross down and shoot against the bar when a close-range header looked the best option. i would have headed that every time but i completely lost it in the lights said the chelsea star. i was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing. we have had a good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers. hopefully that can continue in .
567,brown hits back in blair rift row gordon brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and tony blair was harming the workings of government. jonathan baume of the top civil servants union spoke of competing agendas between mr brown and mr blair. but the chancellor said mr baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge. he said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members jobs. it suited the purpose of mr baume s union the first division association to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms mr brown told bbc radio s today programme. under the plans unveiled in the gershon report some civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services. mr brown said: to be honest i don t think you can rely on his [mr baume s] judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making. mr blair and i are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms. we are determined to go on with the gershon reforms. he also said that as mr baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister he was not in a position to judge. on wednesday ahead of the chancellor s pre-budget report mr baume told bbc news there were sometimes conflicting and competing agendas for government between number and the treasury. what the chancellor wanted was not by any means what alan milburn and the prime minister want to see mr baume said. government departments get their money from the treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that s not necessarily the same as the treasury s and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government. he also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement a policy agenda. the problem is that on many occasions these two don t add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle. number said ministers were interested in governing and not a soap opera about mr blair and mr brown. tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin said: the battle royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and tony blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money.
2048,blair sees greater bush consensus george w bush will display a more consensual approach to world politics as he begins his second term as us president tony blair has said. the prime minister said mr bush had learned military force was not the only way to fight terrorism. he understood that the best prospect of peaceful co-existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights mr blair told the guardian newspaper. mr bush was sworn in at a ceremony in washington dc on thursday. echoing the new us secretary of state condoleezza rice the prime minister said there has been a clear evolution of us policy since the war in afghanistan in . mr blair had personally seen the change over time in conversations with mr bush. the president understood that while military and security measures were important there also needed to be a multilateral approach to solving the world s problems. turning to critics fears that the us was poised for further military action mr blair refused to give succour to suggestions it was preparing for strikes against iran. the prime minister conceded that the us had what appears to be a harder position towards the state than europe. but the prime minister pointed out that until now the us had allowed britain france and germany to take the lead in trying to halt the iranian nuclear programme. following claims that us forces had worked inside iran to identify potential targets mr blair was asked if the sas had also been in the country. we never answer questions about special forces but do not take that as indicating an affirmative said mr blair. mr blair said he believed the president was keen to work with other countries while trying to spread democracy and human rights. it is significant in my view that he is coming to europe as his first foreign visit said mr blair. following his inauguration mr bush is due in europe at the end of january.
1306,us afflicted with awards fatigue the film world and media may be wild about the oscars but cinema-goers and the tv-viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies according to some la film critics. bob strauss from the la daily news thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other. he came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events which roughly translates a celebrity love-in . this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them calling award shows idiotic . as chris rock accurately said they re about celebrity and fashion mr strauss said. the recent grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser and it seems oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way. recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner. unsurprisingly this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue. but entertainment weekly s dave karger maintained the oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster such as titanic or lord of the rings was nominated. the near constant flow of us film awards representing directors actors and producers guilds also means few surprises are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us he said. a quick scan of the los angeles times and los angeles daily news bears this out - speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt. on thursday the times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the kodak theatre to protect the red carpet from rain. variety and the hollywood reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry-related news while in the uk bets have closed on the best actor category with ray star jamie foxx a dead cert to win. screen international s us editor mike goodridge thinks s films have simply not grabbed the public s imagination. film-makers haven t produced films that people adore this year he said. they adored saving private ryan for example - people loved it and it made a ton of money. s films could be a reaction to / - there was a realisation in america that things might not be so rosy after all. audiences don t necessarily want to see darker films such as million dollar baby aviator and finding neverland which end with casualty. as to whether rock could pep up the awards the critics were not hopeful. mr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact but added: i m all for lower ratings though - there are far more important things going on than the oscars. mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers but mike goodridge thought rock s humour could prompt america s conservative states to switch off. so despite all this did the critics have any views on who would win clint eastwood s million dollar baby affected people emotionally which is why it will beat aviator which was about technical artistry not feelings mr karger said. eastwood has it in the bag added mr strauss. oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads. and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin scorsese s aviator and million dollar baby. mr karger whose favourite film of the year was mike leigh s abortion drama vera drake stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments. i hope this is the year for small films to triumph he said. after all it s still one of the biggest tv events of the year.

1240,gadget growth fuels eco concerns technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi-tech products. at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment. ebay also announced the rethink project bringing together intel apple and ibm among others to promote recycling. the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over % in . but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient said the us environmental protection agency (epa). of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices one of the fastest growing markets in technology. the consumer electronics association (cea) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in will reach more than $. billion (nearly £ billion). ebay s initiative pulls together major technology firms environment groups government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them. the online auction house thinks that its already-established community of loyal users could be influential. we really became aware of the e-waste issue and we saw that our million users can be a powerful force for good ebay s david stern told the bbc news website. we saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment. but it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment. teenagers get a new mobile every months adults every months and a million handsets are replaced in total each year. yet only % are actually recycled. this year a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile according to a deloitte report. schemes in the us like ripmobile could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages. the initiative which was also launched at ces rewards to -year-olds for returning unused phones. this system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games said seth heine from ripmobile. one group of students collected mobiles for recycling in just three months. mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes learned behaviour . europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the us in terms of recycling awareness and robust end of life programmes although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too. intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at ces which are entirely lead free. there is more and more awareness on the consumer side but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free intel s allen wilson told the bbc news website. there is still low-level awareness right now but it is on the rise - the highest level of awareness is in europe. a european union (eu) directive weee (waste electronic and electrical equipment) comes into effect in august. it puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them. but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances. elements like chromium lead and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in the eu by . but it is not just about recycling either. the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too. the biggest culprit according to the epa is the innocuous power adaptor nicknamed energy vampires . they provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones pdas (personal digital assistants) digital cameras camcorders and digital music players. although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget. on january new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct. but at ces the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters. these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo meaning they are about % more efficient. the initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers adaptors are being brought on board. most are made in china. about two billion are shipped global every year and about three billion are in use in the us alone. the epa is already working with several companies which make more than % of power supplies on the market. we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat hi-tech devices but also bundle with it a hi-tech efficient power supply the epa s andrew fanara said. initiatives like this are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than % of electricity used in us homes said the epa.
670,dvd copy protection strengthened dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision. the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most but not all of the current dvd ripping (copying) programs used to pirate dvds. ripguard is designed to... reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer said the firm. macrovision said the new technology will work in nearly all current dvd players when applied to the discs but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard. the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales. the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last months taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download. ultimately we see ripguard dvd... evolving beyond anti-piracy and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions interoperability in tomorrow s digital home and the upcoming high-definition formats said steve weinstein executive vice president and general manager of macrovision s entertainment technologies group. macrovision said ripguard was designed to plug the digital hole that was created by so-called decss ripper software. it circumvents content scrambling system measures placed on dvds and let people make perfect digital copies of copyrighted dvds in minutes. those copies could then be burned onto a blank dvd or uploaded for exchange to a peer-to-peer network. macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against rent rip and return - where people would rent a dvd copy it and then return the original. ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of the company said. the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used those programs will now most likely crash the company said. macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures.

803,software watching while you work software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a pc but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled. worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. the developers behind the system claim it is a break-through in the way data is monitored and stored. but privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software. the system is a joint venture between security firm and storage specialists bridgehead software. they have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes. more and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the national hi-tech crime unit (nhtcu) a survey conducted on its behalf by nop found evidence that more than % of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime. bridgehead software has come up with techniques to prove to a legal standard that any stored file on a pc has not been tampered with. ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the freedom of information act which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time. the storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm which allows every action on a computer to be logged. potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party copied printed deleted or saved to cd floppy disk memory stick or flash card. other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use. increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data such as governments are using biometric log-ins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time. privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee s privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff. that is not the case said tim ellsmore managing director of . it is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof he said. people need to recognise that you are using a pc as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data he added.
1939,england claim dubai sevens glory england beat fiji - in a dramatic final in dubai to win the first irb sevens event of the season. having beaten australia and south africa to reach the final england fell behind to an early try against fiji. they then took charge with scores from pat sanderson kai horstman mathew tait and rob thirlby but fiji rallied to force a tense finale. scotland were beaten - by samoa in the plate semi-final and ireland lost - to tunisia in the shield final. mike friday s england side matched their opponents for pace power and skill in the final and led - at half-time. but neumi nanuku and marika vakacegu touched down for fiji only for a needless trip by tuidriva bainivalu on geoff appleford to allow england to run down the clock. to be honest england have wanted to win in dubai for a very long time now and the people here have wanted us to win for just as long said friday. we didn t want to put pressure on ourselves but we are thankful we have achieved that and brought through some young talent at the same time that can hopefully play for the england in a few years. portugal confirmed their impressive progress in sevens rugby by recording a sudden-death win over france in the bowl final. samoa won the plate title by edging out argentina -.
1273,millions to miss out on the net by % of the uk s population will still be without internet access at home says a study. around million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to million or % of the uk who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is wishful thinking the report concludes. the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access it predicts. the gap between have-nets and have-nots has been much talked about but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark the report suggests. internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it said adrian hosford director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits said mr hosford. as now the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families the older generation and the disabled. those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots the disabled will make up % and the elderly nearly a third by the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome he said. if we don t address this problem now it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs education opportunities will be limited and they ll simply not be able to keep up with society he said. the alliance for digital inclusion an independent body with members drawn from government industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.
907,butler launches attack on blair former civil service chief lord butler has criticised the way tony blair s government operates accusing it of being obsessed with headlines. he also attacked the way the iraq war was sold to the public with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out. tory leader michael howard said lord butler had given the most damaging testimony he could remember. but downing street said mr blair should be judged by results not his style. lord butler said mr blair bypassed the cabinet and relied instead on small informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions. the prime minister s official spokesman said the cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues. but he added: you cannot in a modern government take every decision in cabinet. it s just not possible. lord butler said the government had too much freedom to bring in bad bills and to do whatever it likes and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees. the former cabinet secretary said in an interview with the spectator magazine: i would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling there is too much central control and there is too little of what i would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments. mr howard described lord butler s intervention as very important . this is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the blair government. it is certainly the most damaging testimony i can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position. lord butler s report earlier this year into iraq intelligence said the government s september weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was very thin . the reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers case for war lord butler said in his spectator interview which was conducted by the magazine s editor conservative mp boris johnson. he said: when civil servants give material to ministers they say these are the conclusions we ve drawn but we ve got to tell you the evidence we ve got is pretty thin. similarly if you are giving something to the united nations and the country you should warn them. asked why he thought the warnings were not there lord butler said: one has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was. the purpose of the dossier was to persuade the british why the government thought iraq was a very serious threat. when asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole he replied: well. i think we are a country where we suffer very badly from parliament not having sufficient control over the executive and that is a very grave flaw. we should be breaking away from the party whip. the executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad bills a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes - and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow. all that is part of what is bad government in this country. lord butler s assessment was backed by his predecessor as cabinet secretary lord armstrong. lord armstrong told bbc two s newsnight: i agree ... there doesn t appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision-making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect. liberal democrat deputy leader menzies campbell said he thought lord butler s comments were well justified and mr blair s style of leadership was corrosive of the whole system of government . but labour former minister jack cunningham accused lord butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming labour administration when he was cabinet secretary. mr cunningham told bbc radio s today programme: taken together robin butler s comments are partial inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the labour government.
857,sella wants michalak recall former france centre philippe sella believes coach bernard laporte must recall frederic michalak to give his side any chance of beating ireland. sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half yann delaigue in the rbs six nations to date. but he told bbc sport: michalak is the answer both now and for the future. delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back michalak. he does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset ireland. the -year-old michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after delaigue impressed for castres early in the season. with michalak overlooked the french stuttered to narrow wins over scotland and then england before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to wales. the wales game was amazing to watch but never did i think the french could lose that game at half-time said sella. their only mistakes were that they didn t score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second... but only a little bit. sella however insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire laporte despite the defeat at the stade de france. this season is very important for shaping a team for the world cup said sella which laporte is doing very well. the french get better every game. it s difficult though when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel. but he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to world cup victory. as a result it is important that people give him time. it may not seem good now that we re not winning the grand slam but no one will care in two years time if we re world champions. the majority of media criticism centred on the way in which france produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games. but while sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against wales he said the win was most important . winning is all that matters he added. ok the flair may not have been so good but the discipline organisation and defence was there which are all important ahead of . france play what sella believes is their hardest game of the six nations against ireland in dublin on saturday march. the french go into the game as clear underdogs. but sella added: people forget that france can still win the six nations and they ll be focused on that. but ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd. it s going to be tough.
1443,petrol duties frozen brown says chancellor gordon brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the commons on thursday. mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments. but this financial year because of volatility in the oil market he said the duty would be frozen. during many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution. he said: it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services. but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties. the rac welcomed the news calling it an early christmas present for motorists. but the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol. environmental group transport said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists. we are concerned that although britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action said a spokesman. in the people s fuel lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slow-moving convoys after mr brown threatened to raise fuel taxes. the chancellor did not raise duty that year but despite threats of more protests in he added . per litre.
701,peer-to-peer nets here to stay peer-to-peer () networks are here to stay and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms says a panel of industry experts. once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year firms will be very keen to try and make money from technology. the expert panel probed the future of at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january. the first convictions for piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software. since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of technology blaming it for falling sales and piracy. but that is going to change very soon according to the panel. the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. but they have slowly realised that is a good way to distribute content said travis kalanick founder and chairman of network red swoosh and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. they are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards. but until the legal actions are resolved experimentation with cannot not happen said michael weiss president of streamcast networks. remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out mr weiss said: old media always tries to stop new media. when they can t stop it they try to control it. then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money. once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. in august the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast two file-sharing networks. the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the vcr battle and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal. networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. there are now many different types of systems than work in different ways. nets can be used to share any kind of file like photos free software licensed music and any other digital content. the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology. it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use technology to distribute them. the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. the global entertainment industry says more than . billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month and about half a million films are downloaded a day. legal music download services like apple itunes napster have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in with million tracks bought online in the us and europe in months the ifpi reported this week. but such download services are very different from networks not least because of the financial aspect. there are several money-spinning models that could turn into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. paid-for-pass-along in which firms receive money each time a file is shared along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered. we see there are going to be different models for commoditising said marc morgenstern vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer. consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together agreed mr morgenstern. but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry s potential controlling grip on content and technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. unsigned bands for example use networks to distribute their music effectively which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign. increasingly what you are seeing on is consumer-created content said derek broes from microsoft. they will probably pay an increasing role in helping spread he said. looking into s future file sharing is just the beginning for networks as far as mr broes is concerned. once some of these issues are resolved you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content but also in ways that are unimaginable now he said. file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.
1292,home loan approvals rising again the number of mortgages approved in the uk has risen for the first time since may last year according to lending figures from the bank of england. new loans in december rose to slightly higher than november s nine-year low of . mortgage lending rose by £. in december up from a £. rise in november. the figures contradict a survey from the british bankers association which said approvals were at a five-year low. analysts say the figures show the market may be stabilising but still point to further house price softness. the modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in december reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply said global insight analyst howard archer commenting on the boe s figures. the bba believes that the property market is continuing to cool down. changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in november thus flattering the december figures analysts said. in october last year new rules came into force which meant some lenders were forced to withdraw mortgage products temporarily in november and defer some lending until they had made sure they had complied with the rules properly. separately the bank of england said that consumer credit rose by £. in december more than the £. expected and above the £. reported in the previous month.

1750,connors rallying cry for british tennis do you have it in your heart how much guts do you have how much do you hate to lose these are the questions jimmy connors will be asking of britain s brightest tennis hopes in the months and possibly years to come. the american legend swept into london on thursday to announce a long-term relationship with the lawn tennis association after spending three days at the elite performance winter camp in la manga. and the man who epitomised the phrase will to win before lleyton hewitt was even born is clear about the qualities he hopes to convey. you know everybody hits the ball well and there s a very fine line between number one and number said connors. i was that fine line for a long time. but if i can help i want to be part of teaching kids how to win. connors is not the first great name to offer his services to the lta - his long-time rival john mcenroe has repeatedly done the same. but connors is at pains to point out that his interest goes well beyond any publicity stunt and he gave a glowing recommendation to the work of lta performance director david felgate and his team. britain has a different attitude the right attitude in taking the game forward and finding the next wimbledon champion said connors. that s something you don t find every day. everybody talks a good game but not everybody puts that into effect. the impression i came away with after just seeing david and the other coaches for three days was one like i ve never seen before especially over here. this is not going to happen overnight there are no miracle workers but you re going in the right direction. the -year-old s enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis officials back in america. i ve had discussions with the usta (united states tennis association) over a number of years he said. that s where it (my input) ended. connors is a straight-talker and will be equally blunt and honest in his dealings with the lta and the cream of britain s young players. if they re chosen they ve got to produce he said. if not someone will come and take their place. there s only one number one spot and it s lonely up there but it s got the best view. in the year that has seen andrew murray emerge as britain s great new hope connors rejected suggestions that the scot might be put under too much pressure too soon. tim henman has a whole country on his shoulder said connors. i don t know that pressure but if you like that it can be a certain push to get on to the next level. someone s going to have to come and take over from him (henman). if i was andrew murray i d embrace that. that s what we play for. despite the emphasis on hard work training and preparation connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within. the passion i had i don t know if you can find that he admitted. i was also nuts. i say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court. it was the most important thing in the world for me and to do that something s got to be not right with you. there was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of people. what i had when i played tennis is what i am. you have to have that you can t be moulded.
1210,us adds more jobs than expected the us economy added jobs in october - a seven-month high and far more than wall street expectations. in a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected president george w bush the labor department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. jobs were created in every sector of the us economy except manufacturing. while the separate unemployment rate went up to .% from .% in september this was because more people were now actively seeking work. the new jobs added to us payrolls in october was twice the figure that wall street economists had forecast. in addition the labor department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to in september instead of and to in august instead of . the better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in new york with the main dow jones index gaining . points to by late morning trading. it looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year said economist gary thayer of ag edwards & sons. other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the us federal reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to % when it meets next week. it should empower the fed to clearly do something said robert macintosh chief economist with eaton vance management in boston. kathleen utgoff commissioner of the bureau of labor said many of the new construction jobs added in october were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in florida and neighbouring deep south states following four hurricanes in august and september. the dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro as investors returned their attention to other economic factors such as the us s record trade deficit. there is also speculation that president bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.
556,barbarians - new zealand new zealand proved too strong for an australian-dominated barbarians to round off their unbeaten northern hemisphere tour with an easy win. rico gear ran in two of the all blacks seven tries in what was a predominantly second-string line-up. the baa-baas did threaten scoring tries through albert van den bergh xavier rush and andrea lo cicero but never looked like winning. all black aaron mauger was in good form with the boot adding points. the all blacks featured only two of the side which started last weekend s emphatic test victory over france in paris while the baa-baas had nine wallabies in their starting line-up. and new zealand coach graham henry said: it was a quality performance against a very experienced side and a number of young guys came through very well. they learnt from the older players and this was a way of thanking the guys who had been mentoring them on the tour. but the running rugby the crowd had been hoping for rarely materialised. marty holah got the all blacks onslaught under way with his fifth-minute try before rush hit back moments later. but new zealand went ahead once more as gear made use of the space vacated by a temporarily injured chris latham to slide in. ma a nonu then found his way through the barbarians defence to give his side a - half-time lead. the hosts failed to ignite in the second half and the moment gear scored his second just after the interval there was only ever going to be one winner. lo cicero the sole european for the barbarians bundled over for a try to briefly curtail the deficit. but the match was blighted by controversy moments later when justin marshall was felled with a high tackle by jimmy cowan. referee andy turner waved play on and casey laulala coasted in for his side s fifth try. jermoe keino and piri weepu both added tries to the all blacks tally before the final whistle while van den bergh gained some consolation for the baa-baas. after the match barbarians coach bob dwyer warned that south african flanker schalk burger needed a proper off-season break to maintain his standards. burger was recently crowned player of the year by both his peers and the international rugby board but has struggled for form in recent weeks. it s his first year at that level and he was phenomenal up until the end of the southern hemisphere season. i don t think he s played anywhere near that level on tour he said.
1491,nuclear dumpsite plan attacked plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the uk have been branded deeply irresponsible by the liberal democrats. the government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ilw) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the uk. the cash raised will go towards the uk s nuclear clean-up programme. but lib dem norman baker accused ministers of turning britain into a nuclear dumpsite . under current contracts british nuclear fuels should return all but low level waste but none has ever been sent back. in future only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin normally germany or japan under armed guard. intermediate waste from countries such as japan germany spain italy switzerland and sweden will be stored permanently in the uk. at the moment this waste is stored at sellafield in cumbria in the form of glass bricks untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. in a statement the department of trade and industry said the new policy meant there would be a sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries . and it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity. trade secretary patricia hewitt said the new arrangements revealed in a commons written statement would raise up to £ for britain s nuclear clean-up programme under the new nuclear decommissioning agency. but the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the liberal democrats. mr baker the lib dem environment spokesman said: i have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times. but now our worst fears have been confirmed. once again britain s environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the treasury and dti. this is a terrible attempt to offload some of the £ cost of cleaning up nuclear sites. the energy act was supposed to help britain clean up but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite. the nuclear industry is an economic social and environmental millstone that hangs around britain s neck.

1875,oscars race enters final furlong the race for the oscars entered its final stages as the deadline for voters to choose their winners passed. the academy voters had until tuesday afternoon to return their ballots - any late submissions will not be included in the count. the next five days will be spent counting the voting forms and preparing the winners envelopes. best actor nominee leonardo dicaprio is to present a statuette for the first time at the la ceremony on sunday. the -year-old actor who is nominated for playing howard hughes in the aviator will join other hopefuls such as co-star cate blanchett natalie portman and kate winslet as oscar presenters. the only people who will know the oscar winners before they are revealed at the ceremony will be the auditors who are in charge of looking after the ballot count. after collating the results they are responsible for sealing the results in the famous golden envelopes which will be revealed by a host of celebrity presenters at the ceremony. former academy award winners gwyneth paltrow dustin hoffman and halle berry will also present prizes. the event at the kodak theatre will be attended by people including some of the best-known names in film and organisers say they expect it will be watched on television by one billion people around the world. one current concern is the torrential rain which has lashed los angeles for the past week flooding suburbs and causing mudslides. it is hoped the forecast for sunday for cool weather but no rain will prove accurate. the last time it rained on oscars night was in the mid-to-late said oscars communications director john pavlik. we have had rain up until the day before the show many times but for some reason the oscar gods always shine on sunday and we hope they will do so again this year he added.
1030,blair defends terror law changes the prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial saying several hundred people in the uk are plotting terror attacks. the government is facing opposition from tory and lib dem mps and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final commons debate on the changes. but tony blair said there could be no concession on the basic principle . mr blair told the bbc the control orders would only be used in the most limited circumstances. critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders. but the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders instead saying judges will be able to quash them. an explanation is being sent by home secretary charles clarke to all mps and peers ahead of the final debate in the house of commons. on sunday conservative shadow home secretary david davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders. and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last-minute negotiations. some labour mps voted against the legislation last week. barbara follett whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in south africa during the apartheid era confirmed she would vote against the government. but the government is continuing to insist that control orders must be issued by the home secretary. mr blair told bbc radio s woman s hour: we are being advised by the police and the security services... what they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able being sure enough of the proof to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt. and these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances. a yougov poll in the daily telegraph suggested % of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack. but tory leader michael howard told bbc news that the government was again making a mistake in rushing anti-terrorism legislation. i very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this. he said after meeting tony blair he had been left with the impression that he really wasn t interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward . mr clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects - something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights. bbc political correspondent vicky young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the house of lords where labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties. shami chakrabarti director of civil liberties pressure group liberty said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue. she said the legislation was a travesty and a perversion of justice and would remain unpalatable even if a judge was involved early in the process.
618,search wars hit desktop pcs another front in the on-going battle between microsoft and google is about to be opened. by the end of microsoft aims to launch search software to find any kind of file on a pc hard drive. the move is in answer to google s release of its own search tool that catalogues data on desktop pcs. the desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as google aol yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files. microsoft made the announcement about its forthcoming search software during a call to financial analysts to talk about its first quarter results. john connors microsoft s chief financial officer said a test version of its desktop search software should be available for download by the end of the year. we re going to have a heck of a great race in search between google microsoft and yahoo he said. it s going to be really fun to follow. microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users. the program could be based on the software microsoft owns as a result of its purchase of lookout software in early october. on october google released desktop search software that catalogues all the files on a pc and lets users use one tool to find e-mail messages spreadsheets text files and presentations. the software will also find webpages and messages sent via aol instant messenger. many other firms have released desktop search systems recently too. companies such as blinkx copernic enfish technologies and x-friend all do the same job of cataloguing the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. apple has also debuted a similar search system for its computers called spotlight that is due to debut with the release of the tiger operating system. due to follow are net giants aol and yahoo. the latter recently bought stata labs to get its hands on search software that people can use. microsoft is also reputedly working on a novel search system for the next version of windows (codenamed longhorn). however this is not likely to appear until . the recent activity in the search industry shows that there is a need to move beyond simple keyword-based web search said kathy rittweger co-founder of blinkx. finding information of our own computers is becoming as difficult as it is to find the relevant webpage amongst the billions that exist. desktop search has become important for several reasons. according to research by message analysts the radicati group up to % of the information critical to keeping many businesses running sits in e-mail messages and attachments. jf sullivan spokesman for e-mail software firm sendmail said many organisations were starting to realise how important messaging was to their organisation and the way the work. the key thing is being able to manage all this information he said. also search is increasingly key to the way that people get around the internet. many people use a search engine as the first page they go to when getting on the net. many others use desktop toolbars that let them search for information no matter what other program they are using. having a tool on a desktop can be a lucrative way to control where people go online. for companies such as google which relies on revenue from adverts this knowledge about what people are looking for is worth huge amounts of money. but this invasiveness has already led some to ask about the privacy implications of such tools.
1859,camera phones are must-haves four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of than last year says a report from analysts gartner. globally the number sold will reach million an increase of %. the report predicts that nearly % of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by . improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly must-have buy. in europe cameras on mobiles can take . megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific where camera phone technology is much more advanced mobiles have already been released which can take . megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology and the uptake there is huge. by according to gartner % of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them. camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services). this has changed in the last months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways they have introduced more design features like rotating screens and viewfinders removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages. mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites or mobile blogs - moblogs. but the report suggests that until image quality increases more people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. the gartner report suggests that by mid- it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. some handsets already feature limited zoom capability and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions like nightclubs. other developments include wide-angle modes basic editing features and better sensors and processors for recording film clips. images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists. the exhibition fonetography will feature images taken by photographers david bailey rankin and nan goldin and artists sir peter blake tracey emin and jack vettriano. but some uses for them have worried many organisations. intel samsung the uk s foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. many schools fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. italy s information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers profits. according to recent figures sony ericsson s profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. over % of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras it said.

2061,turkey deal to help world peace a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership is of fundamental importance to the peace and security of the world tony blair has said. the deal struck at the european council last week also proved claims of a clash between muslims and christians were wrong mr blair said. it represented the achievement of an historic british objective he added. tory leader michael howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the eu was anti-islamic . turkey s involvement with the eu would provide an invaluable bridge between europe and the rest of the world mr howard added. but the tory leader argued that the eu constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as turkey. mr blair has been a leading advocate of turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. he insisted that the turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records. the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus. it was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but turkish premier recep erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full eu membership. the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member but turkey which occupies northern cyprus had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country calling the issue a red line . it could take up to years before turkey is able to join and entry cannot be guaranteed. if it joins turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april . however talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia.
853,uk economy ends year with spurt the uk economy grew by an estimated .% in after accelerating in the last quarter of the year says the office for national statistics (ons). the figure is in line with treasury and bank of england forecasts. the ons says gross domestic product (gdp) rose by a strong .% in the three months to december compared with .% in the previous quarter. the rise came despite a further decline in production output and the worst christmas for retailers in decades. the annual figure marked out the best year since and was also well ahead of the .% recorded in . growth in the final three months of marked the consecutive quarter of expansion. on the basis of the latest information the uk has entered on course to continue its record period of growth said paul boateng chief secretary to the treasury in a statement. the ons said the services sector which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the uk economy grew .% in the quarter. the strong services figure was welcomed by analysts given lacklustre retail sales in december and across the christmas holiday period. the fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and i am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown said ross walker uk economist at rbs financial markets. however output in the production sector contracted .% the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession. however the ons would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over. but steve radley chief economist at the manufacturers organisation eef said: these figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground. whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year recession is not a word that manufacturers would currently recognise. the ons said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying which was driven by oil and gas extraction was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures. simon rubinsohn chief economist at gerrard said: this outturn (of .%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the uk economy. and he said the gdp figures may help to push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve . the suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than a downward direction. this is consistent with our own thinking said mr rubinsohn. the bank of england s nine-strong rate-setting committee voted unanimously earlier this month to keep interest rates steady at .% minutes of the meeting showed on wednesday.

28,terror suspects face house arrest uk citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary. it comes after law lords ruled that the detention of foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights. charles clarke s planned control orders mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest curfews or tagging. the law society dubbed mr clarke s new proposals an abuse of power . deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in belmarsh prison in london under the current laws introduced after the us terror attacks on september . mr clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin algeria tunisia egypt and jordan without them facing torture or death. under the proposed changes - prompted by the house of lords ruling - the home secretary could order british citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet. british citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects. mr clarke also said intelligence reports showed some british nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats. human rights lawyer clive stafford-smith said the plans were a further abuse of human rights in britain . mr clarke said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in serious cases with independent scrutiny from judges. he told mps: there remains a public emergency threatening the life of the nation. he accepted the law lords ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists. the current detainees would not be freed until the new powers were in place as they were still considered a national security threat he told mps. there have been calls for the rules for wire-tap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but mr clarke refused to back that change. he said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources lives at risk. most of the terror suspects are being held indefinitely at belmarsh prison in london. conservative shadow home secretary david davis was worried about extending special powers to cover british citizens. he warned: throughout history internment has generally backfired because of the resentment it creates. so unless the process is clearly just the home secretary could find himself confining one known terrorist only to recruit unknown terrorists. he suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court. liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten also backed use of wire-tap evidence. he said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be very high indeed and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws. shami chakrabarti from human rights group liberty joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials. she said: adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse. the government should not swap one human rights opt out for another.

772,redford s vision of sundance despite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses robert redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star-struck crowds at sundance. it s a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in park city utah back in the . now in its twenty-first year sundance continues to grow. some people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind. it s an opportunity to meet and make deals. redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent film-makers but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream. smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance which take place during the same week in park city are competing for sundance s limelight. but redford is not worried. the more the merrier he says. the point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them. once independent film had a place where the work could be seen suddenly the merchants came. with them the celebrities came then the paparazzi - and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone explains redford. people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film he adds. international film-makers have always been celebrated here but is the first year a dedicated world dramatic and documentary competition is being held. redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the american media fails to reflect particularly how the us is perceived internationally. he has never hidden the fact that he is a democrat. but he reserves particular disdain for the current republican administration. it s the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration he says. i think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view. that s very unhealthy and very dangerous. if we take that policy into the world there will be the same victims and the same consequences. sundance isn t just one big screening. there are discussion panels and q&a sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like america s culture wars and the iraq war. while redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic. educated middle class and predominantly white americans comes sundance with views from the same end of the political spectrum - anti-war and socially liberal. but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience. when you look at the films here what we are presenting is very much egalitarian. and it s about good films and good story-telling be it african america asian women gay lesbian. sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say it s just a film by so-and so .

1702,call to overhaul uk state pension the uk pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think-tank. the pensions policy institute (ppi) said replacing the state pension with a citizen s pension would help tackle inequality and complexity. the change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the uk rather than national insurance (ni) contributions. reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records. the ppi added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions. the think tank s proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the pensions commission s initial report into uk retirement savings. according to the pensions commission s report million working people are not saving enough for their retirement. as a result living standards could fall for the next generation of uk pensioners. the report added that a combination of higher taxes higher savings and/or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the uk pension crisis.
